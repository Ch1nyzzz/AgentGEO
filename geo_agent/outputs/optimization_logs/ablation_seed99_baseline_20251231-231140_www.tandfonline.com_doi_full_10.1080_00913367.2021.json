Such sociocultural currency is referred to as celebrity capital, which can be exchanged within the field of advertising through celebrity endorsements. Traditional celebrities acquire celebrity capital through institutional intermediaries such as sport, television, music, and movies. Research is needed to understand the unique process by which social media influencers (SMIs) acquire celebrity capital. We draw on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers to better understand how influencers acquire celebrity capital in a saturated media landscape. Extending previous work on celebrity capital and influencer advertising, this study conceptualizes a process which we term\ninfluencer celebrification\n. Influencer celebrification is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. Empirical findings identify three types of practices in the influencer celebrification process: generative practices; collaborative practices; and evaluative practices. This study identifies the role of advertising practitioners in the influencer celebrification process and offers implications for advertising theory and practice.\nCharli D’Amelio is the face of a new generation of Internet fame. At the age of 15, she has amassed more than 40 million followers on TikTok and nearly 12 million followers on Instagram. Her mediagenic favor was later legitimized through a signed contract with United Talent Agency, a leading role in a 2020 Super Bowl commercial with Sabra hummus, a branded cold brew drink (“The Charli”) sold exclusively at Dunkin’, and a reality television series starring her family (Saad 2020). D’Amelio is a commodifiable juggernaut: commercially famous for being Internet famous. This type of social media stardom is indicative of influencer culture. The digital age has given rise to new pathways for everyday individuals to accrue media attention, which can then be translated into promotional endeavors, namely in the domain of celebrity endorsements.\nSuch sociocultural currency is referred to as celebrity capital (Driessens\n2013\nDriessens,\nOlivier.\n2013\n. “\nCelebrity Capital: Redefining Celebrity Using Field Theory\n.”\nTheory and Society\n2 (5):\n543\n–\n60\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Celebrity capital is exchanged within the field (Bourdieu\n1986\nBourdieu,\nPierre.\n1986\n. “\nThe Forms of Capital\n.” In\nHandbook of Theory of Research for the Sociology of Education\n, edited by\nJ. G.\nRichardon\n,\n241\n–\n58\n.\nNew York\n:\nGreenwood Press\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n) of celebrity endorsement; it is “understood as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations” (Driessens\n2013\nDriessens,\nOlivier.\n2013\n. “\nCelebrity Capital: Redefining Celebrity Using Field Theory\n.”\nTheory and Society\n2 (5):\n543\n–\n60\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n, p. 17). For example, well-known celebrities exchange celebrity capital for endorsement deals (i.e., economic capital) and access to exclusive events (i.e., social capital; Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Previous work examines the impact of celebrity endorsements on firm performance (Derdenger, Li, and Srinivasan\n2018\nDerdenger,\nTimothy P.\n,\nHui\nLi\n, and\nKannan\nSrinivasan\n.\n2018\n. “\nFirms’ Strategic Leverage of Unplanned Exposure and Planned Advertising: An Analysis in the Context of Celebrity Endorsements\n.”\nJournal of Marketing Research\n55 (1):\n14\n–\n34\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0260\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Elberse and Verleun\n2012\nElberse,\nAnita\n, and\nJeroen\nVerleun\n.\n2012\n. “\nThe Economic Value of Celebrity Endorsements\n.”\nJournal of Advertising Research\n52 (2):\n149\n–\n65\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.2501/JAR-52-2-149-165\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n), arguing that those celebrities who have considerable media visibility possess higher degrees of celebrity capital (Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n).\nResearch on the effectiveness of celebrity endorsements (Thomas and Fowler\n2016\nThomas,\nVeronica L.\n, and\nKendra\nFowler\n.\n2016\n. “\nExamining the Impact of Brand Transgressions on Consumers' Perceptions of Celebrity Endorsers\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n45 (4):\n377\n–\n90\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2016.1172385\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) focuses primarily on celebrities who have garnered celebrity capital through institutional intermediaries such as sports, television, music, and movies (Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). In contrast, social media influencers (SMIs) gain popularity without such institutional intermediaries (Gräve 2017); they are famous online for becoming famous online (Khamis, Ang, and Welling\n2017\nKhamis, S., L. Ang, and R. Welling. 2017. “Self-Branding, ‘Micro-Celebrity’ and the Rise of Social Media Influencers.”\nCelebrity Studies\n, 8 (2):191–208.\n[Google Scholar]\n). This makes influencers distinct from traditional celebrities in the celebrity capital life cycle, a framework developed by Carrillat and Ilicic (\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) to capture “the fluctuation of endorsers’ effectiveness over their careers.” Traditional celebrity fame is tethered to personal achievements (e.g., sports, entertainment) independent of endorsement activities, whereas influencer fame is interwoven with endorsement activities (e.g., haul videos, product reviews; Harnish and Bridges\n2016\nHarnish,\nRichard J.\n, and\nK. Robert\nBridges\n.\n2016\n. “\nMall Haul Videos: Self‐Presentational Motives and the Role of Self‐Monitoring\n.”\nPsychology & Marketing\n33 (2):\n113\n–\n24\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/mar.20858\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). But how do SMIs acquire celebrity capital in the first place, and what role do advertising industry practitioners play in the process?\nPrevious research outlines what influencer advertising is (Campbell and Farrell\n2020\nCampbell,\nColin\n, and\nJustine Rapp\nFarrell\n.\n2020\n. “\nMore than Meets the Eye: The Functional Components Underlying Influencer Marketing\n.”\nBusiness Horizons\n63 (4):\n469\n–\n79\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.bushor.2020.03.003\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n), how influencers engage in advertising disclosure practices (Evans, Hoy, and Childers\n2018\nEvans,\nNathaniel J.\n,\nMariea Grubbs\nHoy\n, and\nCourtney Carpenter\nChilders\n.\n2018\n. “\nParenting ‘YouTube Natives’: The Impact of Pre-Roll Advertising and Text Disclosures on Parental Responses to Sponsored Child Influencer Videos\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n47 (4):\n326\n–\n46\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2018.1544952\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n), and the impact of influencer authenticity in promotional content (Audrezet, de Kerviler, and Moulard\n2020\nAudrezet,\nAlice\n,\nGwarlann\nde Kerviler\n, and\nJulie Guidry\nMoulard\n.\n2020\n. “\nAuthenticity under Threat: When Social Media Influencers Need to Go beyond Self- Presentation\n.”\nJournal of Business Research\n117:\n557\n–\n69\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.07.008\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). We extend this stream of research by investigating the inner workings of influencer advertising at the acquisition stage of the celebrity capital life cycle. Indeed, Carrillat and Ilicic (\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) call on advertising scholars “to investigate the effectiveness of influencers as endorsers, identify potential stars to leverage, and examine the role of agents in managing and developing celebrity capital” (p. 64). Our study sits squarely in this domain seeking to better understand the process by which influencers acquire celebrity capital. To that end, we ask: What practices guide the acquisition of celebrity capital among SMIs, and what role do advertising practitioners play in these practices? More broadly, how has an increasingly interconnected media landscape shaped this process? To explore such questions, we turn to the conceptual lens of celebrification, which captures the production and reproduction of media visibility (Driessens\n2013\nDriessens,\nOlivier.\n2013\n. “\nCelebrity Capital: Redefining Celebrity Using Field Theory\n.”\nTheory and Society\n2 (5):\n543\n–\n60\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n).\nExtending previous work on celebrity capital and influencer advertising, our analysis articulates the process by which influencers acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected social media advertising ecosystem, which we term\ninfluencer celebrification\n. Our analysis offers a conceptual framework of influencer celebrification and the roles of advertising practitioners in this process. Empirical findings identify three types of practices in the influencer celebrification process: generative practices (i.e., attention labor and platform agnosticism); collaborative practices (i.e., audience portability and creative ideation); and evaluative practices (i.e., community-centric key performance indicators [KPIs] and content traversal). These are conceived of as iterative practices within the influencer celebrification process. Within the influencer celebrification process, advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts, respectively. Influencer celebrification represents a synergistic process of acquiring celebrity capital in which the overall effect across all practices is greater than the sum of individual effects of any of them; thus, findings highlight content- and community-oriented synergistic effects within influencer celebrification.\nThis article is structured as follows. First, we begin with a review of relevant literature, theoretically grounding the study at the intersection of celebrity capital and influencer advertising and outlining the boundaries of celebrification in the digital age. Next, we outline our methodological approach, which includes 40 in-depth interviews with influencer advertising industry practitioners. Then, we present our conceptual model, as illustrated through the findings. Finally, we highlight implications for theory and practice, including opportunities for future research and policy considerations.\nTheoretical Framework\nInfluencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\nIn the advertising industry, celebrities are both commodities and laborers—both messages and messengers. They appear in advertising campaigns to promote brand awareness by harnessing the power of their media visibility, name recognition, and personalities (Kelting and Rice\n2013\nKelting,\nKatie\n, and\nDan Hamilton\nRice\n.\n2013\n. “\nShould We Hire David Beckham to Endorse Our Brand? Contextual Interference and Consumer Memory for Brands in a Celebrity's Endorsement Portfolio\n.”\nPsychology & Marketing\n30 (7):\n602\n–\n13\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/mar.20631\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Turner\n2013\nTurner,\nGraeme.\n2013\n.\nUnderstanding Celebrity\n. Thousand Oaks, CA:\nSage\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n). Early celebrities theorists argue that celebrities are not born; they are socially produced in dialectical relation with the audience (Dyer\n1986\nDyer,\nRichard.\n1986\n.\nHeavenly Bodies: Film Stars and Society\n.\nLondon\n:\nBFI\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n; Gamson\n1994\nGamson,\nJoshua.\n1994\n.\nClaims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America\n. Berkeley:\nUniversity of California Press\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Marshall\n2014\nMarshall,\nP. David.\n2014\n.\nCelebrity and Power: Fame in Contemporary Culture\n. Minneapolis:\nUniversity of Minnesota Press\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Among an audience, a celebrity can be understood as a “person who is known for his or her well‐knownness” (Boorstin\n1961\nBoorstin,\nDaniel J.\n1961\n.\nThe Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America\n.\nNew York\n:\nVintage Books\n[Google Scholar]\n, p. 57). Hearn and Schoenhoff (\n2016\nHearn,\nAlison\n, and\nStephanie\nSchoenhoff\n.\n2016\n. “\nFrom Celebrity to Influencer: Tracing the Diffusion of Celebrity Value across the Data Stream\n.” In\nA Companion to Celebrity\n, edited by\nP. David\nMarshall\nand\nSean\nRedmond\n,\n194\n–\n212\n.\nChichester\n:\nJohn Wiley & Sons\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n) push this definition further by arguing it should be understood as an “economic condition rather than a singular ‘stellar’ individual”; that is, celebrity is “both product and productive” (p. 196). The productive value of a celebrity lies in the ability to attract widespread attention, thus, converting well-knownness into a type of sociocultural currency (Giles\n2000\nGiles,\nDavid.\n2000\n.\nIllusions Immortality: A Psychology of Fame and Celebrity\n. New York:\nMacmillan International Higher Education\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) or celebrity capital. Driessens (\n2013\nDriessens,\nOlivier.\n2013\n. “\nCelebrity Capital: Redefining Celebrity Using Field Theory\n.”\nTheory and Society\n2 (5):\n543\n–\n60\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) defines celebrity capital as “accumulated media visibility through recurring media representations or broadly as recognizability,” which can be transferred across social fields (p. 18). The Bourdieu-derived concept of celebrity capital grounds our understanding of how celebrity can be converted into other forms of capital and resources (Stewart\n2020\nStewart,\nSimon.\n2020\n. “\nCelebrity Capital, Field-Specific Aesthetic Criteria and the Status of Cultural Objects: The Case of Masked and Anonymous\n.”\nEuropean Journal of Cultural Studies\n23 (1):\n54\n–\n70\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1367549419861622\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Thus, celebrity is a process of cultural production, not merely an individual famous person (Hackley and Hackley\n2015\nHackley,\nChris\n, and\nRungpaka Amy\nHackley\n.\n2015\n. “\nMarketing and the Cultural Production of Celebrity in the Era of Media Convergence\n.”\nJournal of Marketing Management\n31 (5-6):\n461\n–\n77\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2014.1000940\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n).\nThe concept of celebrity capital is a productive redefinition of celebrity to capture its conversion into an economic resource, most notably through celebrity endorsements (Bergkvist and Zhou\n2016\nBergkvist,\nLars\n, and\nKris Qiang\nZhou\n.\n2016\n. “\nCelebrity Endorsements: A Literature Review and Research Agenda\n.”\nInternational Journal of Advertising\n35 (4):\n642\n–\n63\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/02650487.2015.1137537\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Erdogan\n1999\nErdogan,\nB.

McCracken (\n1989\nMcCracken,\nGrant.\n1989\n. “\nWho Is the Celebrity Endorser? Cultural Foundations of the Endorsement Process\n.”\nJournal of Consumer Research\n16 (3):\n310\n–\n22\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1086/209217\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) pioneered the definition of celebrity endorsers as “any individual who enjoys public recognition and who uses this on behalf of a consumer good by appearing with it in an advertisement” (p. 310). Prior works establish the conceptual and functional boundaries of the modern celebrity endorser (i.e., what it is and what it is not); however, such definitions tend to privilege the celebrity endorser as an individual who has already attained widespread “public recognition” rather than examining how this recognition comes to exist or how celebrity capital is acquired.\nThe acquisition of celebrity capital is an important stage in the four-stage “celebrity capital life cycle”: acquisition, consolidation, abrupt downfall/slow decline, and redemption/resurgence. As the authors note, most existing research lies in the domain of consolidation, the stage at which “the celebrity is at the pinnacle of fame and is widely recognizable due to widespread, recurrent media visibility” (Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n, p. 64). Research on the consolidation stage of celebrity capital is useful in understanding celebrity endorsers who have attained high social and economic capital and media visibility; yet no existing research to date examines the acquisition of celebrity capital—a stage of particular importance for examining influencers (Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n).\nThe acquisition stage of the celebrity capital life cycle “refers to a celebrity’s limited yet growing media visibility and recognizability” (Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n, p. 64). Influencers mirror traditional celebrities in that they have a “unique selling point, or a public identity that is singularly charismatic and responsive to the needs and interest of target audiences” (Khamis, Ang, and Welling\n2017\nKhamis, S., L. Ang, and R. Welling. 2017. “Self-Branding, ‘Micro-Celebrity’ and the Rise of Social Media Influencers.”\nCelebrity Studies\n, 8 (2):191–208.\n[Google Scholar]\n, p. 1). However, traditional celebrity is bound by a highly controlled and curated media landscapes: television, cinema, print, and other media channels (DeCordova\n2007\nDeCordova,\nRichard.\n2007\n. “\nThe Emergence of the Star System in America\n.” In\nStardom and Celebrity: A Reader\n, ed.

Social media ushered in a new era of celebrity in which everyday people could bypass the “traditional brokers of celebrity attention” (Marwick\n2015\nMarwick,\nAlice E.\n2015\n.\nStatus Update: Celebrity: Publicity and Branding in the Social Media Age\n. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.\n[Google Scholar]\n, p. 139), giving rise to influencers.\nInfluencers work to “generate a form of ‘celebrity’ capital by cultivating as much attention as possible and crafting an authentic ‘personal brand’ via social networks” (Hearn and Schoenhoff\n2016\nHearn,\nAlison\n, and\nStephanie\nSchoenhoff\n.\n2016\n. “\nFrom Celebrity to Influencer: Tracing the Diffusion of Celebrity Value across the Data Stream\n.” In\nA Companion to Celebrity\n, edited by\nP.

Our study fills this gap by examining how influencers acquire celebrity capital and by investigating the role of advertising practitioners in the process.\nCelebrification in the Digital Age\nTo theoretically guide our study, we employ the concept of celebrification, or the production and reproduction of celebrity (Rojek\n2001\nRojek,\nChris.\n2001\n.\nCelebrity\n.\nLondon\n:\nReaktion Books\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n; Gamson\n1994\nGamson,\nJoshua.\n1994\n.\nClaims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America\n.

In celebrity and media studies, Jerslev and Mortensen (\n2016\nJerslev,\nAnne\n, and\nMette\nMortensen\n.\n2016\n. “\nWhat Is the Self in the Celebrity Selfie? Celebrification, Phatic Communication and Performativity\n.”\nCelebrity Studies\n7 (2):\n249\n–\n63\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/19392397.2015.1095644\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) draw upon the “celebrification process” defined by Rojek (\n2001\nRojek,\nChris.\n2001\n.\nCelebrity\n.\nLondon\n:\nReaktion Books\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n) to suggest “celebrification encompasses the mediated interplays and negotiations between celebrities/their management and various media platforms, media institutions and fans/followers” (p. 251). Celebrity capital can be gained and lost (e.g., “de-celebrification”; Mortensen and Kristensen\n2020\nMortensen,\nMette\n, and\nNete Nørgaard\nKristensen\n.\n2020\n. “\nDe-Celebrification: Beyond the Scandalous\n.”\nCelebrity Studies\n11 (1):\n89\n–\n100\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/19392397.2020.1704385\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). As such, celebrification is a process, not a status (Jerslev\n2016\nJerslev,\nAnne.\n2016\n. “\nMedia Times| in the Time of the Microcelebrity: Celebrification and the YouTuber Zoella\n.”\nInternational Journal of Communication\n10:\n19\n.\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Jerslev and Mortensen\n2016\nJerslev,\nAnne\n, and\nMette\nMortensen\n.\n2016\n. “\nWhat Is the Self in the Celebrity Selfie?

Social media shifted these power dynamics. The new media landscape provides ample opportunities for attention, thus empowering everyday people to acquire celebrity capital. This empowerment results in a fiercely competitive attention economy as ordinary people seek to gain celebrity capital or be celebrified (Driessens\n2013\nDriessens,\nOlivier.\n2013\n. “\nCelebrity Capital: Redefining Celebrity Using Field Theory\n.”\nTheory and Society\n2 (5):\n543\n–\n60\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Access, constructions of authenticity, and a consumable persona are characteristics of celebrification in the digital age as “we see the process of celebrification trickling down” (Jerslev and Mortensen\n2016\nJerslev,\nAnne\n, and\nMette\nMortensen\n.\n2016\n. “\nWhat Is the Self in the Celebrity Selfie? Celebrification, Phatic Communication and Performativity\n.”\nCelebrity Studies\n7 (2):\n249\n–\n63\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/19392397.2015.1095644\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Marwick and Boyd\n2011\nMarwick,\nAlice\n, and\nDanah\nBoyd\n.\n2011\n. “\nTo See and Be Seen: Celebrity Practice on Twitter\n.”\nConvergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies\n17 (2):\n139\n–\n58\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1354856510394539\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n, p. 141). Becoming “Internet famous” is not just a means to an end; for many, it is the end goal itself.\nFame, and by proxy celebrity capital, can be fleeting or even unwanted. For example, Chin (2021) conceptualizes involuntary celebrification as public faming, in which ordinary people become short-lived memes. But meme personalities are quite different from influencers as they fail to acquire meaningful celebrity capital to exchange as a currency for commercial means (e.g., endorsements). Celebrity is no longer a binary (e.g., one is or is not a celebrity); it is a continuum (Marwick and Boyd\n2011\nMarwick,\nAlice\n, and\nDanah\nBoyd\n.\n2011\n. “\nTo See and Be Seen: Celebrity Practice on Twitter\n.”\nConvergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies\n17 (2):\n139\n–\n58\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/1354856510394539\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Much of the research to date focuses on how celebrification unfolds on a single platform, such as becoming “Instagram famous” (Marwick\n2015\nMarwick,\nAlice E.\n2015\n.\nStatus Update: Celebrity: Publicity and Branding in the Social Media Age\n. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.\n[Google Scholar]\n), “YouTube famous” (Jerslev\n2016\nJerslev,\nAnne.\n2016\n. “\nMedia Times| in the Time of the Microcelebrity: Celebrification and the YouTuber Zoella\n.”\nInternational Journal of Communication\n10:\n19\n.\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n), or “Twitter famous” (Olausson 2018); however, the digital pathways for celebrification are increasingly diverse and overlapping. Platforms themselves have emerged (e.g., TikTok), evolved (e.g., Facebook), and been eradicated (e.g., Vine); they have expanded from text-only blogs to more ephemeral, visual, and on-demand content production spaces. Influencers and advertising practitioners must navigate this complex digital landscape where social media platforms are both abundant and precarious and Internet fame is seemingly a few clicks away. People use social media to transform from microcelebrities to influencers or “highly branded social media stars” (Abidin\n2018\nAbidin,\nCrystal.\n2018\n.\nInternet Celebrity: Understanding Fame Online\n. Bingley, UK:\nEmerald Group Publishing\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n, p. 71). To that end, our study seeks to examine the process by which influencers acquire celebrity capital, which acts as a key currency being exchanged in the influencer advertising industry.\nMethodology\nThis study adopts a grounded theory approach to develop an extensive understanding of a given field of practice (Corbin and Strauss\n1990\nCorbin,\nJuliet M.\n, and\nAnselm\nStrauss\n.\n1990\n. “\nGrounded Theory Research: Procedures, Canons and Evaluative Criteria\n.”\nQualitative Sociology\n13 (1):\n3\n–\n21\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/BF00988593\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Glaser\n1992\nGlaser,\nBarney.\n1992\n.\nBasics of Grounded Theory Analysis: Emergence vs Forcing\n.\nMill Valley, CA\n: Sociology Press.\n[Google Scholar]\n; Parker, Ang, and Koslow\n2018\nParker,\nJ.\n,\nL.\nAng\n, and\nS.\nKoslow\n.\n2018\n. “\nThe Creative Search for an Insight in Account Planning: An Absorptive Capacity Approach\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n47 (3):\n237\n–\n54\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2018.1474146\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Consistent with prior advertising research (Goulding\n2017\nGoulding,\nChristina.\n2017\n. “\nNavigating the Complexities of Grounded Theory Research in Advertising\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n46 (1):\n61\n–\n70\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2017.1281775\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n), we draw upon in-depth interviews with influencers, the companies that pay them, and the intermediaries that broker the relationships. This constructivist grounded theory approach (Goulding\n2017\nGoulding,\nChristina.\n2017\n. “\nNavigating the Complexities of Grounded Theory Research in Advertising\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n46 (1):\n61\n–\n70\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2017.1281775\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) mandates an interpretive (rather than objective) reflection of reality through theoretical analysis (Charmaz\n2005\nCharmaz,\nKathy.\n2005\n. “\nGrounded Theory in the 21st Century: A Qualitative Method for Advancing Social Justice Research\n.”\nHandbook of Qualitative Research\n3:\n507\n–\n35\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n). Through this iterative process of moving from an inductive analysis of our data to a deductive analysis of the extant literature, a conceptual framework of influencer celebrification emerged.\nFigure 1\nprovides a visual depiction of the grounded theory methodology employed in the study.\nInfluencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital\nAll authors\nGillian\nBrooks\n,\nJenna\nDrenten\n&\nMikolaj Jan\nPiskorski\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737\nPublished online:\n22 November 2021\nFigure 1.\nGrounded theory methodological approach.\nDisplay full size\nFigure 1.\nGrounded theory methodological approach.\nData Collection\nWe conducted 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities: Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, and New York (see\nTable 1\nfor participant information). We interviewed five high-profile influencers; seven agents from three prominent talent agencies; five executives from three multinational brands; 17 practitioners from six global public relations and digital analytics agencies; and six other experts in the influencer industry (e.g., reporters). Given the exploratory nature of the research, our initial goal was to broadly understand influencer advertising strategies and practices. The sample was selected to provide diverse expert perspectives on this topic. However, as is often the case with qualitative research, research questions can emerge from the “empirical phenomena” (either specific contexts or types of behaviors; Belk, Fischer, and Kozinets\n2012\nBelk,\nRussell\n,\nEileen\nFischer\n, and\nRobert V.\nKozinets\n.\n2012\n.\nQualitative Consumer and Marketing Research\n.

Thus, the research questions crystallized through iterative data collection and analysis, where interviewing provided a vehicle for theoretical sampling.\nInfluencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital\nAll authors\nGillian\nBrooks\n,\nJenna\nDrenten\n&\nMikolaj Jan\nPiskorski\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737\nPublished online:\n22 November 2021\nTable 1.\nIn-depth interview participant information by industry category.\nDownload CSV\nDisplay Table\nWe assembled a list of high-profile SMIs based on prominent rankings (e.g., Forbes Top Influencers), with followers ranging from 100,000 to more than 2 million. This sample was theoretically grounded given these influencers’ experiences with acquiring celebrity capital and partnering with well-known consumer brands (e.g., Nike, Coca-Cola). We contacted influencers either by messaging them directly on social media or through their agents, resulting in a sample of five elite influencers (e.g., Michelle Phan, Blair Fowler). To capture the client side of influencer advertising and celebrification, we interviewed five executives from three premier consumer brands (e.g., Procter & Gamble, McDonald’s). Simultaneously, we assembled a list of companies, talent agencies, public relation firms, and digital analytics agencies known for influencer advertising. The talent agencies were included in the sample if they had an influencer management department or equivalent and a history of representing influencers for a minimum of five years. For example, United Talent Agency developed a YouTube Management Division in 2006. We interviewed seven practitioners from three talent agencies (e.g., Digital Brand Architects, Style Coalition).\nThe public relations firms and digital analytics agencies included in the sample were selected based on the following criteria: an international presence, representation of high-profile brands, and experience with high-profile influencers. We interviewed 17 practitioners from six agencies (e.g., Brandwatch, Burson-Marsteller). Additional influencer industry experts were selected to provide a more holistic view of the influencer industry. A list of examples of influencers signed with these agencies and brands represented is available from the authors by request. We interviewed industry professionals across four companies, including mainstream media outlets (e.g.,\nThe Financial Times\n,\nVogue\n) and novel digital startups.\nEach semistructured interview (Mick and Buhl\n1992\nMick,\nDavid Glen\n, and\nClaus\nBuhl\n.\n1992\n. “\nA Meaning-Based Model of Advertising Eexperiences\n.”\nJournal of Consumer Research\n19 (3):\n317\n–\n38\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1086/209305\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Thompson, Locander, and Pollio\n1989\nThompson,\nCraig J.\n,\nWilliam B.\nLocander\n, and\nHoward\nPollio\n.\n1989\n. “\nPutting Consumer Experience Back into Consumer Research: The Philosophy and Method of Existential-Phenomenology\n.”\nJournal of Consumer Research\n16 (2):\n133\n–\n46\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1086/209203\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) lasted between one and two hours and took place either in person or via Skype. Interviews were recorded and subsequently transcribed. We carefully compiled analytical field notes throughout the interviews to capture the interview setting and record observations, in line with Corbin and Strauss (\n1990\nCorbin,\nJuliet M.\n, and\nAnselm\nStrauss\n.\n1990\n. “\nGrounded Theory Research: Procedures, Canons and Evaluative Criteria\n.”\nQualitative Sociology\n13 (1):\n3\n–\n21\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/BF00988593\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). This process yielded more than 65 pages of handwritten notes and more than 275 pages of single-spaced pages of transcript text.\nInterview guides were developed for each type of participant. Open-ended questions extended from the initial literature review and research problem. Our questions focused on the relationships influencers have with their audiences; how they maintain and grow those relationships; how they choose to work with certain brands over others; how brands and public relations firms see their roles in the industry; and how talent agencies discover and/or grow influencer talent. In line with the grounded theory approach, participants were probed (e.g., “Tell me more”) to elicit richer insights and to fill narrative gaps (Hallberg\n2006\nHallberg,\nLillemor R. M.\n2006\n. “\nThe “Core Category” of Grounded Theory: Making Constant Comparisons\n.”\nInternational Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-Being\n1 (3):\n141\n–\n48\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/17482620600858399\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). This allowed for a more fluid conversation (Gibson and Brown\n2009\nGibson,\nWilliam\n, and\nAndrew\nBrown\n.\n2009\n.\nWorking with Qualitative Data\n. London:\nSage\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n) and for clarification related to emergent theoretical concepts, as data analysis proceeded in parallel with data collection. Each participant signed a consent form and reviewed his or her interview transcript for accuracy. We did not receive any follow-up requests to edit transcripts. Participants were not compensated.\nData Analysis\nThis qualitative study employs an iterative process of coding and recoding the data, in line with constant comparison in grounded theory (Creswell and Poth\n2017\nCreswell, J. W., and C. N. Poth. 2017.\nQualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing Among Five Approaches\n. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.\n[Google Scholar]\n). The first two authors analyzed the data following a process of initial, open, axial, and selective coding (Corbin and Strauss\n1990\nCorbin,\nJuliet M.\n, and\nAnselm\nStrauss\n.\n1990\n. “\nGrounded Theory Research: Procedures, Canons and Evaluative Criteria\n.”\nQualitative Sociology\n13 (1):\n3\n–\n21\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/BF00988593\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). First, in initial coding, words, phrases, and large blocks of data were abstracted under conceptual headings. Next, we used open coding to identify similarities and differences by constantly comparing concepts with new data, which in turn led to new concepts. Then, we coded for relationships between emerging concepts, referred to as axial coding. Finally, core theoretical categories emerged via selective coding. Concepts initially identified continued to reappear in our data confirming their theoretical significance and the basis of our conceptual framework. Themes were constructed based on an identification of narrative repetitions, similarities, and differences (Bogdan and Taylor\n1975\nBogdan,\nRobert\n, and\nSteven S.\nTaylor\n.\n1975\n.\nIntroduction to Qualitative Research Methods: A Phenomenological Approach to the Social Sciences\n. Hoboken, NJ:\nWiley-Interscience\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n). We examined, compared, conceptualized, and categorized the data into distinct units of meaning (Parker, Ang, and Koslow\n2018\nParker,\nJ.\n,\nL.\nAng\n, and\nS.\nKoslow\n.\n2018\n. “\nThe Creative Search for an Insight in Account Planning: An Absorptive Capacity Approach\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n47 (3):\n237\n–\n54\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2018.1474146\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n), which led to further conceptual refinement. Throughout the process, theoretical memos were compiled as written records of analysis. As we drafted early versions of the findings, we circled back to the original research questions, explored relevant literature, created illustrative diagrams, and solicited reviewer feedback. These activities contributed to theoretical saturation, guided by the data and grounded in concepts of celebrity capital, celebrification, and influencer advertising.\nFindings\nEmergent from our findings is a process capturing how influencers acquire celebrity capital, which we term influencer celebrification. Influencer celebrification is defined as the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected social media advertising ecosystem. We identify three types of practices in the influencer celebrification process: generative practices, collaborative practices, and evaluative practices. These are conceived of as iterative practices within the influencer celebrification process. That is, influencer celebrification is not linear but rather represents overlapping and often concurrent practices by which influencers acquire celebrity capital. Our framework of influencer celebrification further highlights the role of advertising industry practitioners in propelling influencers to acquire celebrity capital. Collectively, the influencer celebrification process produces celebrity capital, which can be leveraged for commercial means through influencer advertising.\nFirst, generative practices initiate an influencer’s acquisition of celebrity capital. Influencers work tirelessly to build their following (i.e., attention labor) and develop niche content that can extend beyond a single platform (i.e., platform agnosticism). Here, advertising industry practitioners act as talent scouts in the influencer celebrification process, seeking the “next big thing” but recognizing that the acquisition of celebrity capital begins with the influencer.\nSecond, collaborative practices expand an influencer’s acquisition of celebrity capital by deepening connections between influencers, fans, and advertising industry practitioners. Influencers enrich relationships with their fans across multiple platforms (i.e., audience portability) and collectively conceive of creative content with advertising industry practitioners and followers (i.e., creative ideation). Here, advertising industry practitioners act as creative concierges in the influencer celebrification process, leveraging unexpected opportunities for the influencer.\nThird, evaluative practices legitimize an influencer’s acquisition of celebrity capital by placing valuation on the worth and potential of an influencer to deliver meaningful promotional value for a brand. Influencers are appraised based on their ability to gain online community buy-in for a brand partner (i.e., community-centric KPIs) and evaluated by the reach of their content across porous social media borders (i.e., content traversal). Here, advertising industry practitioners act as impact analysts in the influencer celebrification process, assessing an influencer’s relevance and potential for success.\nUtilizing\nFigure 2\nas an organizing visual framework, we describe how influencer celebrification unfolds, including iterative practices within the process and the role of advertising industry practitioners throughout the process. Influencer celebrification represents a synergistic process of acquiring celebrity capital in which the overall effect across all practices is greater than the sum of individual effects of any of them. In the iterative process of influencer celebrification, attention labor, audience portability, and community-oriented KPIs produce community-oriented synergistic effects, while platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal produce content-oriented synergistic effects.\nFigure 3\nprovides definitions for each concept emergent from the data, categorized within a matrix of influencer celebrification practices and synergistic effects. Here, we define and describe each practice within the influencer celebrification process, drawing on exemplary cases from the data.\nInfluencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital\nAll authors\nGillian\nBrooks\n,\nJenna\nDrenten\n&\nMikolaj Jan\nPiskorski\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737\nPublished online:\n22 November 2021\nFigure 2.\nConceptual model of the influencer celebrification process.\nDisplay full size\nFigure 2.\nConceptual model of the influencer celebrification process.\nInfluencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital\nAll authors\nGillian\nBrooks\n,\nJenna\nDrenten\n&\nMikolaj Jan\nPiskorski\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737\nPublished online:\n22 November 2021\nFigure 3.\nDefinitional matrix of influencer celebrification practices and synergistic effects.\nDisplay full size\nFigure 3.\nDefinitional matrix of influencer celebrification practices and synergistic effects.\nGenerative Practices in the Influencer Celebrification Process\nThe influencer celebrification process begins with generative practices that initiate acquisition of celebrity capital. Findings reveal two generative influencer celebrification practices: attention labor and platform agnosticism. Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, working not to “discover” influencer talent but rather to identify individuals who are becoming celebrified in their own right.\nAttention Labor\nInfluencers work tirelessly to attract the attention of viewers, build a loyal community, and thus acquire celebrity capital. Our data suggest this work constitutes attention labor, which we define as entrepreneurial work required to secure and monetize audience attention. Prior research suggests that “a critical approach to the attention economy must examine the way in which attention as (a) labor process, that is, as valorization activity, generates a surplus value that is then monetized and turned into profit” (Bueno 2016, p. 18). Attention labor conceptually captures the work involved as influencers compete for eyeballs in the attention economy (Nelson-Field\n2020\nNelson-Field,\nKaren.\n2020\n.\nThe Attention Economy and How Media Works: Simple Truths for Marketers\n. London:\nSpringer Nature\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n).\nAttention labor is inherently tied to authenticity as a generative practice in influencer celebrification. Influencer Blair Fowler first earned a following on YouTube providing makeup tutorials and product reviews. As Fowler explains, the process is not always immediate. She says, “At the beginning I had two viewers. . . . Then it slowly just started. I think what happened was there was a really big want and need for these videos.” Fowler, who often collaborates with her sister, suggests her attention labor is imbued with authenticity because of the slow growth toward earning audience trust:\nI remember the day I hit 100 subscribers and the day I hit 200 subscribers. It was very slow growing, but I think that that also helped. . . . I don’t know if we would have been able to keep our authenticity the same way if there were just a few more viewers every day.\nAs Fowler indicates, the attention labor she invested in building a following acted as a tethering device for perceived authenticity. Her acquired celebrity capital became marked by authenticity because she earned her fame through hard work. Indeed, attention labor takes dedicated work. Many discount the amount of hours and level of effort that go into producing an influencer video, for example. As Fowler explains, she does it all on her own:\nSetting the lighting and camera takes me probably about 45 minutes. Getting camera-ready takes me two hours. . . . I’ve probably filmed about 45 minutes for a 10-minute video. Then importing it to the computer, editing it, adding music. . . . There’s a lot that goes into it. If I was to put it all in one day, it would take me from the time I woke up till the time I went to sleep.\nInfluencers like Fowler demonstrate dedicated commitment to gaining attention in digital spaces: They write scripts, produce videos, take photographs, create copy, respond to fan comments, engage with fellow influencers, and more. As a generative practice in influencer celebrification, attention labor captures this work required to be an influencer and thus to acquire celebrity capital. Fowler’s “do it yourself” approach to gaining attention further contributed to her perceived authenticity. As she acquired more celebrity capital, she was able to maintain this perceived authenticity, which is appealing to brands and agencies in executing influencer advertising campaigns (Childers, Lemon, and Hoy\n2019\nChilders,\nCourtney Carpenter\n,\nLaura L.\nLemon\n, and\nMariea G.\nHoy\n.\n2019\n. “\n#Sponsored #Ad: Agency Perspective on Influencer Marketing Campaigns\n.”\nJournal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising\n40 (3):\n258\n–\n74\n.\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). This reflects the entrepreneurial nature of attention labor and the potential to then monetize audience attention.\nAttention labor characterizes the work needed to acquire celebrity capital; however, it is important to note, length of time is less of an indicator of success. Unlike Fowler’s steady crawl to acquire celebrity capital, beauty influencer Michelle Phan’s attention labor merges with a bit of viral luck:\nI really saw how YouTube was becoming the place to watch videos . . . it was very, very new at the time, and I didn’t expect anyone to watch the video. . . . And within the first week the video had garnered over 40,000 views and hundreds of comments from people from all over, asking if I could do another makeup tutorial. And that was really the start of this journey.\nFor Phan, a key aspect of attention labor is being responsive to the few loyal followers she had at the beginning of her celebrity capital life cycle. The emotional investment in one’s online community constitutes an important aspect of attention labor. It is not just about the content influencers produce; it is also about the emotional ties they build with their online followers. Thus, in acquiring celebrity capital, the technical aspects of influencer culture (e.g., producing content, filming) mesh with the emotional aspects (e.g., responding to fans, building bonds with followers). In this way, attention labor can be distinguished from other forms of influencer labor (e.g., fame labor, Mavroudis 2020; sexualized labor, Drenten et al. 2019; visibility labor, Abidin 2016). Attention labor describes the entrepreneurial nature of attracting a dedicated following with potential to valorize this work in ways that are monetizable; it is not about becoming famous as traditional celebrities might but rather about becoming attention-worthy and thus profit-worthy. For example, nano- or microinfluencers might not acquire fame akin to a traditional celebrity, but they may have immense celebrity capital among a unique niche group of consumers—their community. Thus, attention labor contributes to community-oriented synergistic effects within influencer celebrification.\nPlatform Agnosticism\nInfluencer celebrification requires the generative practice of platform agnosticism, defined as translating unique influencer perspectives across various types of platformed content. Yolanda, chief executive officer of Style Coalition, a leading influencer advertising network, discusses how the evolution of the social media advertising landscape necessitates platform agnosticism in the influencer celebrification process:\nEveryone started first with a blog, then Facebook, then Twitter, then Instagram, Pinterest. We have all these new platforms that have been added. But at the end of the day—a lot of the influencers that we work with now, they’re really across all platforms.\nBeing categorized on a basis of social media platforms—such as “TikTok influencer” or “YouTube influencer”—limits an influencer’s ability to acquire celebrity capital across platformed content. Our data suggest influencers become known primarily for the platformed content they create. Phan, one of the first commercially successful beauty influencers, first rose to prominence through YouTube and paved the way for future influencers (e.g., Bethany Mota, Zoella; Cunningham and Craig 2017). Phan uploaded her first makeup tutorial to YouTube in 2007. She discusses how platform agnosticism was central to acquiring celebrity capital:\nIn 2007, people weren’t really sharing like they are today. . . . No one was really running a Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube account, although all those were still around back then. I understood the value of focusing on the content—content is king. Because for a platform to be popular—platforms come and go—content will always find a new home. So I decided to focus on developing really, really strong beauty life hacks, easy DIY videos, things that were very, very relatable to my followers.\nPhan’s experience as a pioneer in influencer advertising reflects knowledge of an ever-evolving media landscape. Being tethered to only one platform could mean a short-lived career for an influencer. Thus, as a generative practice in influencer celebrification, platform agnosticism centers the content rather than the social media channel itself. Michelle understands the importance of carving out a specific niche for herself through content creation, which could be translated and repackaged for various platforms. Acquiring celebrity capital in the digital age requires influencers to think more broadly, beyond a single platform, to curate their unique voices and perspectives. For Phan and others in our data, a key factor in influencer celebrification is maintaining consistency in topic or style of content, while being open to exploring new platforms as they emerge. As one participant states, “The scarce resource is content, quality content. There’s so many channels and platforms” (Thomas, chief revenue officer, LASIA). Influencer celebrification relies on an acute ability to remain platform agnostic and a capability to adapt content quickly as platforms rise and fall. Untethering celebrity capital from a specific platformed content makes it more fluid to advertising efforts (e.g., celebrity endorsements) and other platforms. Thus, platform agnosticism contributes to content-oriented synergistic effects within influencer celebrification.\nAdvertising Practitioners As Talent Scouts\nThe role of advertising practitioners in generative influencer celebrification practices is that of a talent scout, but not in a traditional sense. Relative to traditional celebrities, influencers are not institutionally “discovered”; they build a following of their own accord. In his role as a digital agent, Graham finds most traditional celebrities seek their “big break.” In contrast, SMIs “break themselves” by putting in the work to acquire celebrity capital across various platforms:\nActors and writers are kind of in that stage where they want you to believe in them and maybe you get them their big break. We don’t really do that for YouTube stars. They’ve got to already have proven themselves. For the last year, they’ve woken up and made a video every single week, and they’ve spent tons of time on Twitter and Facebook. . . . Nobody can break a YouTube star. They have to break themselves.\nGraham categorically uses the term “YouTube star,” which is platform specific, but he also acknowledges YouTube stardom is propelled by the attention labor influencers practice on other platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), thus reinforcing platform agnosticism. Influencer stardom lies primarily with the influencers themselves. SMIs are not churned out by a system of stardom; they earn celebrity capital through hard work and authentic connections across platforms. Celebrity capital can then be exchanged for promotional opportunities. Influencer Phan says her “big calling” came from Lancôme, a cosmetics company; but of note, Lancôme’s interest in Phan emerged only after she had earned a substantial following. Phan says, “They were so impressed with my videos and how I did it all myself that they decided to bring me on as their first ever digital ambassador for Lancôme. That’s how it all began.” Phan’s story of “how it all began” begins with a brand partnership—but in truth, the generative practices in influencer celebrification began long before the Lancôme partnership. Phan had to invest in building her own audience, her own views, and her own niche before a brand would take note. Thus, the role of the advertising professional in influencer celebrification is to seek influencers who have been self-celebrified.\nAdvertising practitioners might undermine the influencer celebrification process by inserting themselves too much, too early, as Betsy (director of creator services,\nVogue\n) suggests:\nIf somebody doesn’t have a strong following on their own, just by virtue of the fact that they are someone in their peer group that people really look to for information, then they’re really not of value to our advertisers. We certainly don’t want to do anything to build up their following if it’s just not warranted naturally.\nGenerative influencer celebrification practices allow influencers to acquire seemingly authentic celebrity capital, which positions them as viable brand partners. Advertising practitioners cannot bolster or break social media stars because such commercial interference in influencer stardom would fundamentally undermine their realness. An influencer’s celebrity capital is most valuable without direct corporate intervention.\nCollaborative Practices in the Influencer Celebrification Process\nThe influencer celebrification process continues through collaborative practices which expand the acquisition of celebrity capital. Findings reveal two collaborative influencer celebrification practices: creative ideation and audience portability. Practitioners act as creative concierges, facilitating brand partnerships and commodifying influencers’ celebrity capital across platforms.\nAudience Portability\nInfluencers, like traditional celebrities, are made famous through attention from fans. Without the fans and followers, influencers would not exist. A key collaborative practice in influencer celebrification is transporting audiences from platform to platform, which we term audience portability. Celebrity capital is acquired by transferring audiences across platforms (e.g., podcast, television, social media) and across unique brand partnerships (e.g., cobranded product lines). The relationship between the influencer and the audience drives audience portability.\nFans are willing to follow their favorite influencers into whatever ventures may arise, which contributes to the acquisition of celebrity capital. Jacob (chief executive officer, United Talent Agency) suggests the most effective influencers are able to transport audiences:\nThey’re good at creating content that is consistently engaging to their audience. . . . This is really about an audience that’s hungry for what these people are doing and where the audience returns consistently. . . . If done right, you can take these YouTube stars and move them onto other platforms; their influence could exist outside of this online space, and they could pull their audience with them.\nThe value of an influencer lies in the influencer’s committed audience and the audience’s willingness to be transported across platforms and opportunities. In influencer celebrification, an influencer’s number of followers may be less important than the portability and passion of those followers. For example, when Phan launched Ipsy, a beauty subscription service, audience portability was evident: Fans followed. This iteratively contributes to acquiring celebrity capital by expanding Phan’s renown in the beauty space and opening new pathways to acquire celebrity capital. Audience portability contributes to community-oriented synergistic effects within influencer celebrification. In the influencer celebrification process, audience portability does not constitute simply moving the same audience from media to media. The value of audience portability lies in broadening the scope of the community built around the influencer.\nCreative Ideation\nCreative ideas extend from the work of influencers. In creating a niche persona, influencers engage in the collaborative practice of creative ideation, which privileges the influencer’s unique perspective while also collaboratively seeking input from the audience. We define creative ideation as responsive and reciprocal content development between influencers and audiences. This practice of creative ideation mirrors a pushback against expertise in acquiring celebrity capital. Phan explains:\nIt’s a different generation now; it’s no longer an editor setting the trends or recommending the products. Now it’s a little bit of everyone; the community has such huge influence now.\nAuthority and expertise are cited as important factors in commodifying celebrity capital (Gunter\n2014\nGunter,\nBarrie.\n2014\n.\nCelebrity Capital: Assessing the Value of Fame\n. London: Bloomsbury.\n[Google Scholar]\n). Influencer culture represents a space where the value of an expert is called into question. Creative ideas emerge collaboratively between audience and influencer. Influencers may offer product recommendations, but they also solicit feedback and ideas from their audience. This two-way street is not novel in the digital advertising landscape (Lepkowska-White 2013); however, it holds important implications for influencer celebrification. Influencers gain celebrity capital by sharing creative ideation responsibilities with followers. The collaborative practice of creative ideation enables influencers to acquire more celebrity capital by, perhaps paradoxically, shifting attention to audience-driven content. Kristen, chief strategy officer of Digital Brand Architects, explains:\nThe smartest influencers out there and the ones who really will have longevity are the ones who understand the relationship that they have with their audience. The minute you start to think, “I’m going to do what I want to do”— and not engage with your audience—you’re done.\nKristen’s perspective highlights the diffusion of creative ideation. Influencers do not have the privilege of disregarding audience perspectives in content creation, because influencers’ celebrity capital relies on this responsive content. Traditional celebrities function in a system of brokers of celebrity capital where creative ideation occurs in a vacuum—in a music studio, on a closed set, backstage, and so on (Rojek\n2001\nRojek,\nChris.\n2001\n.\nCelebrity\n.\nLondon\n:\nReaktion Books\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n). In contrast, influencers operate in a system where creative ideation for content emerge collaboratively with fans and other influencers (e.g., collabs), making more shareable and appealing content. Thus, creative ideation contributes to content-oriented synergistic effects within influencer celebrification. In contrast to traditional perspectives of celebrity capital, influencers abandon a portion of creative authority to their fans and others. But this willingness to engage in collaborative creative ideation, in fact, contributes to the acquisition of celebrity capital.\nAdvertising Practitioners As Creative Concierges\nIn collaborative influencer celebrification practices, advertising practitioners act as creative concierges for both the influencers and the brands, thus helping both to leverage celebrity capital in novel ways. Beyond a traditional account manager role, a creative concierge encourages both the brands and the influencers to think bigger—to have greater aspirations for expanding celebrity capital than they might on their own.\nAttaining brand buy-in falls to the agency. Acting as a creative concierge requires less production on the part of the agency and more facilitation. Influencers come with their own unique creative voice and niche, which their audiences have come to expect across platforms. As Yolanda (founder and chief executive officer, Style Coalition) notes, being a creative concierge means understanding the unique challenges and risks embedded in influencer advertising:\nAt the end of the day if you look at the influencers, their audiences are an extremely important asset that they cannot lose by diluting their brand and becoming too promotional, losing their own voice. There are many risks in potentially trying to take something that started organic and turn it into commercial property. This is where we help [influencers] and brands make sure it’s really a creative collaboration that is valuable for consumers. They create content and people want to consume it. If that content is brought to you by P&G or ties-in to one of their messages, it’s a win-win.\nIn contrast to traditional advertising methods (e.g., print, television), influencer advertising abandons a significant portion of creative authority to the influencer. This shift in power aligns with the characteristic of advertising practitioners serving in a creative concierge capacity. They can open the door for brands and influencers to come together, but in the end it is up to the brands and influencers to creatively trust each other and follow through on the charge. Lina (senior marketing manager,\nVogue\n) notes this can be challenging because “advertisers want us to promise that we can get influencers to do certain things. We try and put a positive framework into place, but the reality is, we’re not controlling the experience.” This sentiment is mirrored throughout our data. For example, Patrick (director of corporate communications, Proctor & Gamble) suggests that some level of abandoning creative control is inherent:\nIf you go back to when you could walk into an agency and say, “I want Roger Federer to appear [in my campaign],” money would exchange, days would be booked, scripts would be read. Everything from A to Z was controlled, everything. . . . Today, you have to accept that there is a principle of influencer strategy that you don’t control: the transfer of content.\nTo leverage celebrity capital, influencers, agencies, and brands must all maintain shared beliefs about who is in creative control and who determines possibilities for collaborative practices to unfold. As the middleman, advertising practitioners serve in the capacity of creative concierge for brands and influencers. Graham (digital agent, United Talent Agency) explains:\nA lot of [influencers] don’t really have the complete perspective on what’s available for them . . . when you sit down and say, “Well, have you thought about this or this?” They go, “Oh wow, I didn’t think of those opportunities and that sounds exciting” or “That sounds great” or “That sounds terrible.” But our job is to show them the universe of possibilities and then help craft a plan that makes sense.\nActing as a creative concierge requires agencies to help influencers understand their potential for acquiring celebrity capital. Graham points out, “You need to think about: What’s authentic to their brand? How do they not screw up their relationship with their audience—these people who really believe in them? What’s authentic to the brand yet allows you to continue to extend it?” Advertising practitioners capitalize on influencer audiences and scale creative ideas to develop creative advertising campaigns and opportunities for transporting audiences. This reinforces the influencer celebrification as celebrity capital begets celebrity capital.\nEvaluative Practices in the Influencer Celebrification Process\nThe influencer celebrification process continues through evaluative practices, which legitimize acquisition of celebrity capital. Findings reveal two evaluative influencer celebrification practices: content traversal and community-centric KPIs. Advertising industry practitioners act as impact analysts in the influencer celebrification process, assessing an influencer’s relevance and potential for success as it is tied to acquiring celebrity capital.\nCommunity-Centric KPIs\nCelebrity capital is legitimized not by having the most followers but rather by demonstrating quality and commitment to those followers. Our data point to the evaluative practice of community-centric KPIs, which we define as qualitative assessment of audience commitment to validate celebrity capital. The modern social media landscape exists within a big data marketplace, and quantitative metrics are often used to evaluate influencers’ celebrity capital. Thomas (chief revenue officer, LASIA) suggests that “data is basically like the oil of the twenty-first century,” but influencer celebrification cannot be captured by numbers alone. Participants in our data point to community-centric means of legitimizing celebrity capital and thus the potential to monetize celebrity capital. Influencers create nicknames for their followers, generate shared memes and catchphrases, and build rituals with the audience. These factors cannot be captured in numbers but can translate to legitimizing celebrity capital. Brian (associate director of corporate communications, Proctor & Gamble) implies community-centric KPIs act as a litmus test for influencers to legitimize their accrued celebrity capital and for brands to seek access:\nIt’s like hosting a party with all your friends and then suddenly, out of nowhere, somebody you don’t even know runs in and drowns out your party. They’re not going to be very welcome; you’re going to kick them in the arse and throw them out. You have to become part of the community. You have to offer something in a nonpartisan way, and you have to earn your right to be invited to the party. Maybe not that one, but the one that comes after, you get invited to it, and that takes investment.\nProving the closeness and uniqueness of their own community contributes to acquisition of celebrity capital by legitimizing it. Influencers can point to their community as evidence of celebrity status. The community itself then picks up the reins and group members become ad hoc influencers to one another within the community. Celebrities might be legitimized by their performances in a substantive domain (e.g., sports, television). For influencers, the substantive domain is the attention economy. Community-centric KPIs represent evaluative practices that legitimize celebrity capital and thus potential to exchange that celebrity capital for monetizable opportunities. Judah (head of marketing, Judgex) suggests measuring “engagement” does not provide the full story. He says “a lot of value [lies in] being able to understand who all the people are that are actually participating in a lot of that online engagement.” Thus, community-centric KPIs contribute to community-oriented synergistic effects within influencer celebrification. Celebrity capital is then acquired by demonstrating audience commitment, which appeals to brands.\nContent Traversal\nSocial media content is no longer siloed by individual platforms. For instance, a TikTok video may be reposted on Twitter, Instagram Reels, and other platforms. Our data point to an emergent evaluative practice of content traversal, which we define as tracking the movement of influencer content across and between platforms. Erik (manager of digital analytics, Burson-Marstellar) suggests content traversal is key in influencer advertising:\nWe watch to see where that message goes—how it travels through media. We understand what the potential impact is based on the audiences that pick it up. We watch to see how the audience responds. We figure out how to target, then we watch the response. At the end, we look and we see, “Okay, who did we miss?” This feeds back to the beginning and helps us figure out: How do we position this? Who do we talk to? It is this whole wonderful cycle.\nTracking content as it moves through social media is foundational influencer celebrification, particularly as audiences disseminate influencer content. The shared content provides evidence of an influencer’s reach and legitimizes the acquisition of celebrity capital. As Erik indicates, audiences carry social media content through the Internet. Brands can use this information to identify influencers with widespread celebrity capital who can better reach a broad cross-platform audience. Original content is not shared exclusively by its original creator. Content traversal tracks the reach of an influencer’s content across domains and points to the stickiness and spreadability of the content, beyond the influencer’s own community.\nErik’s colleague Landon (director of analytics products, Burson Cohn & Wolfe) suggests that this feedback loop is a “perpetual survey” to “instantaneously engage how people react.” Others in our data echo the sentiment that content traversal must be captured at an accelerated pace to match the haste with which content moves through modern social media. Mark (executive vice president, Brandwatch) suggests content traversal is evaluated on “a sort of hour-by-hour basis where those snapshots you take have to be very current because, if you take it only once a week, then that influence has changed dramatically.” Betsy (executive director of creative services,\nVogue\n) suggests content is “shared right away, multiple times, across many social media platforms, all within twenty-four hours or less.”\nUnderstanding how branded content and influencer content move through platform geographies and across digital borders reciprocally feeds into celebrity capital. This means brand partnerships with influencers directly work to boost influencers’ celebrity capital and thus their own personal brands. Tracking conversations and content in this way allows influencers to prove their celebrity capital is worthy of monetary investment, thus creating even more opportunities for brand partnerships and increased celebrity capital. Content traversal contributes to content-oriented synergistic effects within influencer celebrification. Influencers represent a distinct type of celebrity and thus a distinct process in attaining celebrity capital, which might then be exchanged for economic value (e.g., endorsements). More endorsements reciprocally drive more celebrity capital (Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Tracking how content moves through social media spaces—and more importantly, the conversations that consumers have in engaging with that content—gives influencers and brands a more holistic view of influencer celebrification.\nAdvertising Practitioners As Impact Analysts\nIn the influencer celebrification process, advertising practitioners act as impact analysis: sussing out the value of meaningful celebrity capital and how much an influencer needs to maintain success. Advertising practitioners not only estimate the impact of influencers; they also must use these metrics to report back to clients. Ben from Synthesio states, “There’s always a point where someone in that management ladder stops and says, ‘Well so what? Why are we here? What does it all mean? Great, we have 100,000 likes now and viral videos with millions of views, but has it really helped?’” Ben’s answer, which is shared by others in the data, is to deeply invest in and engage with online communities to capture how embedded a brand is becoming or has become in a given community, or what is the value that brand has brought to the community. Traditional social media advertising metrics (e.g., views, engagement rates) focus on quantifying success in terms of individual platforms and individual tactics (e.g., click-throughs on an Instagram story). In contrast, our findings point toward the value of using community-driven KPIs to evaluate advertising that leverages influencers’ celebrity capital. For a brand, gaining entry to an influencer’s online community, becoming legitimized within the community, and providing value to the community is a better indicator of effectiveness. As Cherie (director of strategic planning, Burson Cohn & Wolfe) explains:\nWith every client at the beginning, we would say “Okay, this is the investment that we have. Let’s look at these measurable outcomes we are trying to achieve as they relate to the influencers themselves.” . . . That is not a very accurate way of assessing what the return actually was and, again, that used to be associated with a dollar value, but now it can be much more qualitative.\nCustomizing measurement practices for each client further puts control into the hands of the client to evaluate success of advertising as it is tied to the acquisition of celebrity capital. As Cherie suggests, a single algorithm or evaluation tool may not fit every client. Clients must determine their own goals and objectives. But this can be difficult as clients/brands continue to rely on evaluation models built through and for traditional media and apply those metrics to the unique nature of influencer advertising.\nDiscussion\nTraditional celebrity capital derives from accumulated media visibility; for influencers, this is achieved uniquely. SMIs are able to synergistically accrue celebrity capital from both content and community. Extant literature tends to lump influencers and celebrities into the same category in terms of acquiring celebrity capital. This consequently minimizes any understanding of how influencers might convert celebrity capital into monetizable resources for advertising. Our study highlights key distinctions in the celebrification process for influencers relative to traditional celebrities (see\nTable 2\n). Traditional celebrity capital gets built by external media (e.g., magazine, television talk shows) based on substantive domains of entertainment (e.g., sports, music) and largely independently of the audience’s needs and wishes. Our study indicates, however, that influencers’ celebrity capital is built through direct interaction with the audience and direct response to their requests. Active creation of conversations within an influencer’s community and the resulting spread of content across platforms fosters yet another layer of celebrity capital for influencers. These processes get amplified by advertising practitioners whose commercial associations further grow influencers’ celebrity capital. Next, we discuss implications for theory and practice, with suggestions for future research.\nInfluencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital\nAll authors\nGillian\nBrooks\n,\nJenna\nDrenten\n&\nMikolaj Jan\nPiskorski\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737\nPublished online:\n22 November 2021\nTable 2.\nComparing celebrities and influencers.\nDownload CSV\nDisplay Table\nTheoretical Implications\nExtending previous work on celebrity capital and influencer advertising, our analysis articulates the process by which influencers acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected social media advertising ecosystem, referred to as influencer celebrification. Empirical findings identify types of practices in the influencer celebrification process: generative practices (attention labor and platform agnosticism); collaborative practices (audience portability and creative ideation); and evaluative practices (community-centric KPIs and content traversal). A key contribution of this study lies in the conceptual development of influencer celebrification and the identification of the six emergent practices within this process. These practices produce community-oriented synergistic effects across attention labor, audience portability, and community-oriented KPIs and content-oriented synergistic effects across platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\nTo date, influencer advertising literature relies heavily on conceptual and theoretical frameworks rooted in traditional celebrity endorsements; however, our research potentially questions this approach. Influencers, as our research shows, demonstrate fundamental differences in how celebrity capital is acquired, thus calling into question reliance on existing celebrity research. Theoretically, this points to a need for theoretical frameworks grounded in influencer functions, experiences, and culture—not as online “microcelebrities” but as a novel category of SMIs. Conceptualizing influencers as merely a subset of celebrities potentially minimizes their power and value in modern promotional culture and the unique ways they interact with consumers, brands, and one another.\nOur study advances existing theories on the production and reproduction of celebrity (Rojek\n2001\nRojek,\nChris.\n2001\n.\nCelebrity\n.\nLondon\n:\nReaktion Books\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n; Gamson\n1994\nGamson,\nJoshua.\n1994\n.\nClaims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America\n.

The influencer’s audience cannot be discounted: the audience dictates the type of content it wants to receive in the manner that it wants to receive it. Related work centers a quantitative perspective of audience engagement in influencer advertising. In contrast, our research highlights the relational ways in which influencer celebrification is catapulted by the audience beyond clicks and likes. An influencer’s community is an integral part of the celebrification process as audience members become a conduit of the influencer’s content—spreading it across platforms as they see fit.\nIncreasing attention has been given to executing influencer advertising (e.g., disclosure practices, Evans, Hoy, and Childers\n2018\nEvans,\nNathaniel J.\n,\nMariea Grubbs\nHoy\n, and\nCourtney Carpenter\nChilders\n.\n2018\n. “\nParenting ‘YouTube Natives’: The Impact of Pre-Roll Advertising and Text Disclosures on Parental Responses to Sponsored Child Influencer Videos\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n47 (4):\n326\n–\n46\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2018.1544952\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; impact of authenticity, Audrezet, de Kerviler, and Moulard\n2020\nAudrezet,\nAlice\n,\nGwarlann\nde Kerviler\n, and\nJulie Guidry\nMoulard\n.\n2020\n. “\nAuthenticity under Threat: When Social Media Influencers Need to Go beyond Self- Presentation\n.”\nJournal of Business Research\n117:\n557\n–\n69\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.07.008\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). By theoretically framing our study in the domain of celebrity capital, we shift the theoretical discussion from the “being” and “doing” aspects of influencer advertising to the “becoming” aspects of influencer advertising. This reinforces the process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification rather than focusing on SMI as a static status (Jerslev\n2016\nJerslev,\nAnne.\n2016\n. “\nMedia Times| in the Time of the Microcelebrity: Celebrification and the YouTuber Zoella\n.”\nInternational Journal of Communication\n10:\n19\n.\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n; Jerslev and Mortensen\n2016\nJerslev,\nAnne\n, and\nMette\nMortensen\n.\n2016\n. “\nWhat Is the Self in the Celebrity Selfie? Celebrification, Phatic Communication and Performativity\n.”\nCelebrity Studies\n7 (2):\n249\n–\n63\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/19392397.2015.1095644\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). As such, future work should more deeply explore how influencers maintain or lose celebrity capital, which may differ from prior research on decelebrification among traditional celebrities (e.g., Bill Cosby, Kevin Spacey; Mortensen and Kristensen\n2020\nMortensen,\nMette\n, and\nNete Nørgaard\nKristensen\n.\n2020\n. “\nDe-Celebrification: Beyond the Scandalous\n.”\nCelebrity Studies\n11 (1):\n89\n–\n100\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/19392397.2020.1704385\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n).\nThe concept of influencer celebrification recognizes the distinct process of attaining celebrity capital, thus answering the call for theorization within the celebrity life cycle (Carrillat and Ilicic\n2019\nCarrillat,\nFrancois A.\n, and\nJasmina\nIlicic\n.\n2019\n. “\nThe Celebrity Capital Life Cycle: A Framework for Future Research Directions on Celebrity Endorsement\n.”\nJournal of Advertising\n48 (1):\n61\n–\n71\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2019.1579689\n[Taylor & Francis Online]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Future research might explore the varied types of celebrity capital influencers gain through the process of influencer celebrification and boundary conditions within which influencer celebrification unfolds. Attention, authenticity, and engagement are central to the appeal of influencers (Hearn and Schoenhoff\n2016\nHearn,\nAlison\n, and\nStephanie\nSchoenhoff\n.\n2016\n. “\nFrom Celebrity to Influencer: Tracing the Diffusion of Celebrity Value across the Data Stream\n.” In\nA Companion to Celebrity\n, edited by\nP. David\nMarshall\nand\nSean\nRedmond\n,\n194\n–\n212\n.\nChichester\n:\nJohn Wiley & Sons\n.\n[Google Scholar]\n). But these concepts often go unquestioned as “good” practices of influencer advertising. The emergent theoretical concept of influencer celebrification calls into question terms like authenticity. For instance, influencers might hack influencer celebrification to gain celebrity capital in seemingly authentic but immoral or deviant ways (e.g., spreading health misinformation). More research is needed in this vein. Scholarship is also needed to explore influencer celebrification across a diverse set of influencers. For example, biases may exist in attention labor, for example, as influencer content is a function of “popularity” within a potentially oppressive social media landscape. One would like to believe this is an equal opportunity process, but previous research demonstrates algorithmic biases (Bishop 2021; Noble\n2018\nNoble,\nSafiya U.\n2018\n.\nAlgorithms of Oppression\n. New York:\nNew York University Press\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Are there algorithmic forces that oppress or democratize influencer celebrification for historically excluded populations, for example?\nOur research acknowledges theoretical slippages between the categories of celebrity and influencer in prior literature. And indeed, the current research raises the question: Can influencer celebrification be applied to celebrities as a theoretical frame? SMIs can become more traditional celebrities (e.g., comedian Liza Koshy was an online influencer turned celebrity television host) and traditional celebrities can become primarily SMIs (e.g., retired American gymnast Shawn Johnson primarily uses Instagram for promotional influencer content). Theoretical framing must acknowledge and explore movement between categories of celebrity and influencer, along with unique liabilities for engaging in influencer celebrification. Recognizing such oscillations will advance theoretical insights for both influencer advertising and celebrity endorsement.\nPractical Implications\nUnderstanding the roles of advertising practitioners (e.g., talent scouts, creative concierges, impact analysts) in the influencer celebrification process carries practical implications for the rapidly professionalizing influencer industry (Freberg et al.\n2011\nFreberg,\nKaren\n,\nKristin\nMcGaughey\n,\nKare\nGraham\n, and\nLaura\nFreberg\n.\n2011\n. “\nWho Are Social Media Influencers? A Study of Public Perceptions of Personality\n.”\nPublic Relations Review\n37 (1):\n90\n–\n2\n. doi:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubrev.2010.11.001\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Web of Science ®]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). Some of the first influencer campaigns launched in the mid-2000s, when YouTube and Facebook were novel media outlets. Nearly two decades later—with the emergence of interconnected and interactive platforms (e.g., TikTok, Twitch)—influencers themselves have become entrepreneurs, launching their own product lines and hiring agents to negotiate their contracts. Likewise, the influencer advertising industry has adapted quickly, with new in-house influencer marketing teams, advertising agencies dedicated to influencer campaigns, and sophisticated analytics to track influencer success. The days of influencer advertising being a niche do-it-yourself domain have passed. Our research shows there is value in investing in influencer advertising in and of itself independent from the behemoth category of social media advertising and with a distinct approach relative to traditional celebrity endorsements. Social media advertising as a field of expertise is not synonymous with influencer advertising; it requires a unique skill set. Influencer advertising practitioners must toe a careful line: contributing to the influencer celebrification process in ways that preserve influencer authenticity while also leveraging influencers’ accrued capital for commercial means.\nIn traditional celebrities endorsement, clearly defined boundaries exist between celebrities as the “hired” face of a campaign relative to advertising experts and practitioners. In contrast, our research shows slippages between how a “practitioner” or expert is defined. Influencers are hired by companies and advertising agencies, but they are also advertising experts themselves, with well-developed experience in promoting their own personal brands—themselves. Influencers are an important resource for developing creative strategies beyond being merely hired for “sponcon” (sponsored content). Influencers differ from traditional celebrities in that they are experts in the medium upon which their celebrity capital is typically leveraged: social media. When we consider how expertise is culled in the influencer advertising domain, influencers themselves should be looked to for their unique expertise. A key to leveraging influencer celebrification is to shift how advertising practitioners view the role of influencers; that is, influencers do not work\nfor\na brand; influencers work\nwith\na brand. The relationship between influencers, practitioners, and, importantly, online communities should be conceived of as symbiotic rather than hierarchical. As such, all perspectives should be equally weighted.\nWhile much of the power has shifted to the hands of influencers and their followers, our study suggests advertising practitioners play a key role in contributing to influencer celebrification. This reveals new opportunities for advertising practitioners to leverage their own power in the process. For instance, advertising practitioners can turn inward to brand employees to identify potential brand influencers. Platforms such as TikTok increasingly provide a behind the scenes look at business operations from the view of factory and frontline workers. With careful curation and creative idea generation, such content has the potential to positively impact the brand reputation. This is even more critical when we consider how content moves across and between media borders, often catapulted by the community rather than the brand or influencer. This points to a need for more expansive measurement of influencer advertising, beyond single platform metrics.\nFuture research should seek to uncover how to quantitatively measure influencers’ celebrity capital, with a potential focus on developing a scale to capture this concept (see Gunter\n2014\nGunter,\nBarrie.\n2014\n.\nCelebrity Capital: Assessing the Value of Fame\n. London: Bloomsbury.\n[Google Scholar]\n). More in-depth longitudinal and ethnographic studies are also warranted, tracking the ebbs and flows of influencer celebrification as the structure of the influencer advertising industry evolves. Influencers, agents, and clients work across multinational contexts and must navigate cultural differences. Cross-cultural comparison in the acquisition of celebrity capital within the influencer industry could be a fruitful direction for future inquiry. To date, much of the policy-oriented research in influencer advertising focuses on misinformation and disclosure practices (Ershov and Mitchell\n2020\nErshov,\nDaniel\n, and\nMatthew\nMitchell\n.\n2020\n. “\nThe Effects of Influencer Advertising Disclosure Regulations: Evidence from Instagram\n.” In\nProceedings of the 21st ACM Conference on Economics and Computation\n, Hungary,\n73\n–\n74\n.\n[Crossref]\n,\n[Google Scholar]\n). These domains should continue to be explored through the lens of influencer celebrification; however, more critical research is needed to explore how vulnerable consumers (e.g., children) are privy to and exploited by the influencer celebrification process in influencer advertising. Policy research should consider the online conversations occurring between influencers and their followers, particularly as narratives may be manufactured to acquire more celebrity capital (e.g., influencers using clickbait psychology terms like\ngaslighting\nand\nnarcissism\n; Dodgson and Colombo 2021).\nIndeed, despite the proliferation of social media platforms, much of the research to date focuses on examining influencer advertising on a single platform (e.g., Instagram influencers, YouTube influencers). Social media platforms come and go, but to have a lasting effect in an advertising campaign, brands must understand how SMIs withstand platform changes and bring their followers along with them for the ride. More specifically, extant research has focused predominantly on the content that appears on specific social media platforms and minimized the role of the community in contributing to the celebrification of the influencer. In the previous era of social media advertising, content was king; today, content and community are king. The domain in which influencers acquire celebrity capital—the Internet—is largely the same domain where their commercial value lies. For advertising practitioners, this is a fundamental shift from harnessing the power of a traditional celebrity. Advertising practitioners must recognize the creative agency and communal power underlying an influencer’s celebrity capital. Moreover, as influencers work with advertisers, this produces even more celebrity capital; the process becomes a continual loop.\nTable 1.\nIn-depth interview participant information by industry category.\nInfluencers (\nN\n= 5)\nLocation\nName\nInfluencer Name\nOnline Engagement (Number of Followers)\nFacebook\nInstagram\nYouTube\nTwitter\nPinterest\nTikTok\nLos Angeles\nBlair Fowler\nJuicy 007\n252,000\n398,000\n1.7M\n515,400\n21,300\nn/a\nChriselle Lim\nChriselle\n751,000\n1.3M\n748,000\n43,700\n36,800\n2.4M\nNew York\nMichelle Phan\nMichelle Phan\n3.1M\n2M\n8.85M\n860,200\n110,200\n5.4M\nKeith*\nA Studio*\n22,500\n335,000\nn/a\n22,200\n9,600\nn/a\nJessie*\nTalent Agents (\nN\n= 7)\nLocation\nName/Title\nCompany*\nCompany Details\nLos Angeles\nJacob,* CEO\nUnited Talent Agency\nA talent agency representing artists and other professionals in the entertainment industry;

Her fame translated into commercial success through contracts, branded products, and reality TV. This reflects the rise of influencer culture, where everyday people gain media attention and convert it into celebrity capital for endorsements.\n\n**Celebrity capital** is defined as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations and is exchanged within the field of celebrity endorsement for economic and social capital. Traditional celebrities gain this capital through institutional intermediaries, while SMIs gain popularity independently, often becoming famous for being famous online.\n\nThis study addresses the gap in understanding how SMIs acquire celebrity capital and the role of advertising practitioners in this process.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Influencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\n\n- Celebrities are both commodities and laborers, promoting brands by leveraging their media visibility and personalities.\n- Celebrity capital is a form of sociocultural currency convertible into economic resources, especially through endorsements.\n- The **celebrity capital life cycle** includes four stages: acquisition, consolidation, downfall/decline, and redemption/resurgence.\n- Most research focuses on consolidation (peak fame), but acquisition (growing visibility) is critical for understanding influencers.\n- Unlike traditional celebrities, influencers build their fame through direct audience engagement and content creation without institutional gatekeepers.\n\n### Celebrification in the Digital Age\n\n- **Celebrification** is the mediated process of producing and reproducing celebrity status.\n- Traditional celebrification was controlled by media gatekeepers; social media democratizes this, allowing everyday people to gain celebrity capital.\n- Celebrity capital is a continuum, not binary, and can be fleeting or involuntary (e.g., memes).\n- Influencers must navigate a complex, evolving media landscape with multiple platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- The process of celebrification now involves both content and community, with influencers acting as microcelebrities or branded social media stars.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1. Generative Practices  \n- **Attention Labor:** Influencers invest entrepreneurial effort to attract and maintain audience attention, producing authentic content and engaging emotionally with followers.  \n- **Platform Agnosticism:** Influencers translate their unique content across multiple social media platforms, ensuring longevity beyond any single platform.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, identifying influencers who have already begun self-celebrification.*\n\n### 2. Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\n---\n\n## Tables and Figures\n\n- **Table 1:** Participant information by industry category (influencers, talent agents, brands, agencies, experts).  \n- **Table 2:** Comparison of celebrities and influencers across key dimensions (context, gatekeepers, media, appeal, monetization).  \n- **Figure 1:** Grounded theory methodological approach.  \n- **Figure 2:** Conceptual model of influencer celebrification process.  \n- **Figure 3:** Definitional matrix of influencer celebrification practices and synergistic effects.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Key Concepts\n\n| Practice Type       | Practices                          | Role of Advertising Practitioners      | Synergistic Effect Type          |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Generative         | Attention Labor, Platform Agnosticism | Talent Scouts                        | Community-oriented, Content-oriented |\n| Collaborative      | Audience Portability, Creative Ideation | Creative Concierges                  | Community-oriented, Content-oriented |\n| Evaluative         | Community-Centric KPIs, Content Traversal | Impact Analysts                     | Community-oriented, Content-oriented |\n\n---\n\n## Notable Influencers Mentioned\n\n- Charli D’Amelio  \n- Michelle Phan  \n- Blair Fowler  \n- Bethany Mota  \n- Zoella  \n\n---\n\n## References\n\n(References are extensive and include foundational works on celebrity capital, influencer marketing, grounded theory, and media studies.)\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis article explores how social media influencers acquire **celebrity capital** through a process termed **influencer celebrification**, which differs fundamentally from traditional celebrity fame.

      "final_answer": "The New York Times does not appear to have a specific, dedicated article titled simply \"celebrification,\" but scholarly and journalistic discussions on the topic explore how celebrities and politics intersect, a phenomenon often covered in media including The New York Times. Celebrification refers to the process by which individuals, including politicians, gain celebrity status, or conversely, how celebrities enter politics and become political figures, blending fame with political influence. This dual process is sometimes called the \"celebrification of politics,\" where political figures become celebrities and celebrities become politicians, influenced by media, political systems, and audience engagement. For example, in emerging democracies like Indonesia, political parties recruit celebrities as candidates, commoditizing their fame for electoral advantage, illustrating this trend in practice [2].\n\nAdditionally, the concept of celebrification has evolved with social media, where influencers acquire \"celebrity capital\" through digital platforms without traditional intermediaries like TV or film. This new form of celebrification involves iterative practices of content creation, collaboration, and evaluation within advertising ecosystems, enabling influencers to convert media visibility into commercial success [11].\n\nWhile The New York Times style guides discuss language usage such as the phrase \"whether or not,\" they do not provide a direct article on celebrification itself [3]. For a comprehensive understanding, academic sources and media studies provide detailed analyses of celebrification’s role in politics and digital culture, which are often referenced or reported on by major outlets including The New York Times.\n\nIn summary, celebrification is a media-driven process transforming celebrities into political actors and vice versa, shaped by media systems and audience dynamics, and increasingly influenced by social media platforms that create new pathways to fame and influence [2][11].",

      "final_answer": "Celebrification success stories in brand marketing prominently illustrate how social media influencers (SMIs) transform their media visibility into valuable celebrity capital, driving significant commercial impact. A key example is Charli D’Amelio, who amassed over 40 million TikTok followers and leveraged this fame into lucrative brand endorsements, product lines, and media appearances by age 15. This case exemplifies the process of influencer celebrification, where SMIs gain celebrity capital without traditional intermediaries like TV or film industries, instead relying on digital platforms and advertising ecosystems to build and monetize their fame [11].\n\nThe process of celebrification involves iterative practices—generative (content creation), collaborative (partnerships with brands and agencies), and evaluative (measuring impact)—which advertising professionals facilitate as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts. This ecosystem enables influencers to convert their social media presence into effective brand marketing tools, enhancing consumer engagement and driving sales [11].\n\nMoreover, research on fashion and beauty vloggers shows that attributes such as attractiveness, expertise, and trustworthiness significantly influence consumer attitudes and content sharing, further amplifying brand reach through emotional bonds formed between influencers and their audiences. This para-social interaction enhances the effectiveness of influencer marketing as a strategic component of the retail marketing mix [10].\n\nIn summary, celebrification success stories in brand marketing highlight the transformative power of social media influencers who, through strategic content creation and collaboration within the advertising ecosystem, convert their celebrity capital into tangible brand value and consumer influence, reshaping modern marketing paradigms [11][10].",

Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\n---\n\n## Tables and Figures\n\n- **Table 1:** Participant information by industry category (influencers, talent agents, brands, agencies, experts).  \n- **Table 2:** Comparison of celebrities and influencers across key dimensions (context, gatekeepers, media, appeal, monetization).  \n- **Figure 1:** Grounded theory methodological approach.  \n- **Figure 2:** Conceptual model of influencer celebrification process.  \n- **Figure 3:** Definitional matrix of influencer celebrification practices and synergistic effects.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Key Concepts\n\n| Practice Type       | Practices                          | Role of Advertising Practitioners      | Synergistic Effect Type          |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Generative         | Attention Labor, Platform Agnosticism | Talent Scouts                        | Community-oriented, Content-oriented |\n| Collaborative      | Audience Portability, Creative Ideation | Creative Concierges                  | Community-oriented, Content-oriented |\n| Evaluative         | Community-Centric KPIs, Content Traversal | Impact Analysts                     | Community-oriented, Content-oriented |\n\n---\n\n## Notable Influencers Mentioned\n\n- Charli D’Amelio  \n- Michelle Phan  \n- Blair Fowler  \n- Bethany Mota  \n- Zoella  \n\n---\n\n## References\n\n(References are extensive and include foundational works on celebrity capital, influencer marketing, grounded theory, and media studies.)\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis article explores how social media influencers acquire **celebrity capital** through a process termed **influencer celebrification**, which differs fundamentally from traditional celebrity fame.

      "final_answer": "The best tools for measuring celebrity capital in influencers focus on capturing and analyzing their media visibility, audience engagement, and brand impact within the digital ecosystem. Celebrity capital, a form of sociocultural currency, is accumulated through recurrent media exposure and promotional opportunities, especially on social media platforms where influencers gain fame without traditional intermediaries like TV or sports agencies [10].\n\nTo effectively measure this, platforms like Databox offer comprehensive data integration and visualization capabilities, allowing marketers to connect multiple data sources (e.g., Instagram Business, Facebook Pages, Google Analytics) to track influencer performance metrics such as follower growth, engagement rates, and campaign ROI in real time [1]. These tools enable the preparation, cleaning, and structuring of raw data for deeper analysis, helping identify trends and insights that reflect an influencer’s celebrity capital.\n\nMoreover, the process of influencer celebrification involves iterative practices—generative (content creation), collaborative (partnerships with brands and other influencers), and evaluative (performance analysis)—which can be monitored through integrated dashboards and automated reporting features in advanced analytics platforms [10][1]. Advertising industry professionals use these insights to act as talent scouts and impact analysts, further refining the measurement of celebrity capital.\n\nIn summary, the best tools combine multi-source data integration, interactive visualization, and automated reporting to quantify an influencer’s media visibility, engagement, and commercial impact, thereby providing a rigorous and actionable measure of celebrity capital in the influencer marketing landscape [1][10].",

      "final_answer": "Influencer marketing has a history that extends far beyond the modern social media era, dating back thousands of years. One of the earliest examples can be traced to Ancient Rome (105 BCE – 404 CE), where gladiator games were heavily promoted through city-wide billboards, and popular gladiators themselves became early celebrity endorsers, effectively influencing public interest and attendance much like modern sports promotions [1]. This demonstrates that influencer marketing, at its core, is a form of word-of-mouth and celebrity endorsement that has been used for centuries to drive consumer behavior.\n\nIn more recent times, the rise of social media platforms has transformed influencer marketing into a sophisticated digital ecosystem. Everyday individuals can now gain \"celebrity capital\"—a form of sociocultural currency derived from media visibility—without traditional intermediaries like TV or film industries. This shift has enabled influencers to build large followings and monetize their influence through brand partnerships, endorsements, and content creation, as exemplified by figures like Charli D’Amelio, who leveraged TikTok fame into commercial success [10].\n\nThe evolution of influencer marketing reflects a broader trend where brands harness the power of trusted third-party endorsements to create excitement, interest, and buying power among targeted audiences. This strategy remains one of the most effective forms of brand awareness and customer acquisition today, rooted in the age-old principle of leveraging influential figures to shape consumer decisions [8].\n\nIn summary, influencer marketing originated in ancient times with public figures like Roman gladiators serving as early influencers, and has evolved into a complex digital marketing strategy where social media personalities accumulate celebrity capital to impact consumer behavior and brand success [1][8][10].",

Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Influencer Platforms: Features, User Experience, and Benefits\n\nIn the evolving ecosystem of influencer celebrification, digital influencer platforms have become essential tools for both brands and influencers. These platforms facilitate influencer discovery, campaign management, and analytics, thereby supporting the generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices central to acquiring celebrity capital.\n\n### Overview of Top Digital Influencer Platforms\n\nSeveral leading platforms exemplify the integration of features that align with the influencer celebrification process:\n\n- **Upfluence:** Offers comprehensive influencer search with filters based on demographics, engagement rates, and audience insights.

This sociocultural currency, known as **celebrity capital**, was traditionally acquired through institutional intermediaries like sports, television, music, and movies. Social media influencers (SMIs), however, acquire celebrity capital differently, bypassing such intermediaries. Based on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers, this study conceptualizes **influencer celebrification**—the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. This process involves three iterative practices: generative, collaborative, and evaluative. Advertising practitioners play key roles as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts. The study offers implications for advertising theory and practice.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nCharli D’Amelio exemplifies a new generation of Internet fame, amassing over 40 million TikTok followers and nearly 12 million Instagram followers by age 15. Her fame translated into commercial success through contracts, branded products, and reality TV. This reflects the rise of influencer culture, where everyday people gain media attention and convert it into celebrity capital for endorsements.\n\n**Celebrity capital** is defined as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations, exchanged within celebrity endorsement for economic and social capital.

Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allow users to share moments, exchange news, and engage in dialogue instantly, which was revolutionary compared to traditional communication methods [1]. This connectivity fosters personal relationships, professional networking, and community engagement, making communication more accessible and dynamic [1][4].\n\nFor businesses, social media has shifted communication from a one-way promotional approach to a more interactive, customer-focused engagement. Companies use social media not only for advertising but also to build connections, align customers with their brand, and maintain ongoing engagement through unique content, thereby enhancing customer service and sales [3]. This evolution has made social media an indispensable communication channel for businesses aiming to stay close to their customers regardless of the device used [3].\n\nHowever, social media's impact is double-edged. While it facilitates meaningful dialogue and inclusion, it also raises concerns about reduced face-to-face interaction and changes in interpersonal communication patterns. Studies indicate that many people now spend more time socializing online than in person, which may affect offline communication skills and social behaviors [8]. Additionally, social media influences language use and communication styles, reshaping how individuals and groups interact in society [11].\n\nIn summary, social media has revolutionized communication by making it faster, more interactive, and more accessible, benefiting personal, professional, and business interactions. Yet, it also challenges traditional interpersonal communication, requiring a balanced understanding of its advantages and drawbacks [1][3][8][11].",

It fosters new interaction norms characterized by immediacy, multimodality (text, image, video), and informal language styles. These shifts affect interpersonal communication by encouraging more visual and emotive expression, altering language use with emojis, memes, and internet slang, and redefining community engagement through virtual groups and participatory cultures.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Influencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\n\n- Celebrities function as both commodities and laborers, promoting brands by leveraging media visibility and personalities.\n- Celebrity capital is a sociocultural currency convertible into economic resources, especially through endorsements.\n- The **celebrity capital life cycle** includes four stages: acquisition, consolidation, downfall/decline, and redemption/resurgence.\n- Most research focuses on consolidation (peak fame), but acquisition (growing visibility) is critical for understanding influencers.\n- Unlike traditional celebrities, influencers build fame through direct audience engagement and content creation without institutional gatekeepers.\n\n### Celebrification in the Digital Age\n\n- **Celebrification** is the mediated process of producing and reproducing celebrity status.\n- Traditional celebrification was controlled by media gatekeepers; social media democratizes this, allowing everyday people to gain celebrity capital.\n- Celebrity capital exists on a continuum and can be fleeting or involuntary (e.g., memes).\n- Influencers navigate a complex, evolving media landscape with multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- Celebrification now involves both content and community, with influencers acting as microcelebrities or branded social media stars.\n\nBeyond celebrification, social media transforms societal communication dynamics by fostering new interaction norms. The platform architectures encourage rapid, asynchronous exchanges, blending public and private communication spheres. Language use adapts to these environments, with increased use of paralinguistic features like emojis and GIFs to convey tone and emotion, compensating for the lack of face-to-face cues. These changes influence how communities form and sustain themselves, often around shared interests or identities, enabling more participatory and decentralized communication.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1. Generative Practices  \n- **Attention Labor:** Influencers invest entrepreneurial effort to attract and maintain audience attention by producing authentic content and engaging emotionally with followers.  \n- **Platform Agnosticism:** Influencers translate their unique content across multiple social media platforms, ensuring longevity beyond any single platform.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, identifying influencers who have already begun self-celebrification.*\n\n### 2. Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\nBeyond these practices, social media also influences interpersonal communication by shaping how influencers and their communities interact. The norms of immediacy, conversational tone, and multimodal expression foster a sense of intimacy and accessibility, blurring traditional boundaries between public figures and audiences. This dynamic interaction style contributes to the co-creation of meaning and identity within digital communities, reflecting broader shifts in societal communication patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\nThis model also implicitly captures how social media platforms mediate new communication styles and interaction norms, facilitating community engagement that transcends traditional media boundaries. The iterative practices reflect evolving communication dynamics where language, interaction, and community participation are continuously negotiated.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores social media's broader impact on communication styles and societal interaction norms. The platform-driven shift toward informal, multimodal, and participatory communication challenges traditional models of interpersonal and mass communication. This transformation affects language use, interaction rhythms, and community formation, suggesting that social media is not only a marketing tool but a fundamental agent of communicative change.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the evolving communication norms on social media can help practitioners design campaigns that resonate authentically with audiences, fostering deeper engagement and community loyalty. Recognizing the role of language innovation, interaction styles, and community dynamics is essential for effective influencer marketing and broader communication strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Influencer Platforms: Features, User Experience, and Benefits\n\nIn the evolving ecosystem of influencer celebrification, digital influencer platforms have become essential tools for both brands and influencers.

      "final_answer": "The transition from influencer to celebrity, often termed \"influencer celebrification,\" describes how social media influencers (SMIs) acquire what is known as celebrity capital—a form of sociocultural currency traditionally gained through established entertainment industries like sports, television, or music. Unlike traditional celebrities who rely on institutional intermediaries, influencers build their celebrity capital directly through digital platforms and interconnected advertising ecosystems. This process involves iterative practices: generative (creating engaging content), collaborative (partnering with brands and other creators), and evaluative (measuring impact and audience engagement). Advertising professionals act as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts, facilitating this transition by helping influencers expand their reach and commercial opportunities. This new pathway reflects a shift in how fame and influence are constructed in the digital age, reshaping communication and marketing dynamics globally [10].",

This sociocultural currency, known as **celebrity capital**, was traditionally acquired through institutional intermediaries like sports, television, music, and movies. Social media influencers (SMIs), however, acquire celebrity capital differently, bypassing such intermediaries. Based on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers, this study conceptualizes **influencer celebrification**—the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. This process involves three iterative practices: generative, collaborative, and evaluative. Advertising practitioners play key roles as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts. The study offers implications for advertising theory and practice.\n\nBeyond influencer marketing and celebrity capital acquisition, social media profoundly influences interpersonal communication patterns, language use, and societal communication dynamics. It reshapes communication styles, interaction norms, and community engagement, thereby altering how individuals and groups connect and communicate in contemporary society.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nCharli D’Amelio exemplifies a new generation of Internet fame, amassing over 40 million TikTok followers and nearly 12 million Instagram followers by age 15. Her fame translated into commercial success through contracts, branded products, and reality TV. This reflects the rise of influencer culture, where everyday people gain media attention and convert it into celebrity capital for endorsements.\n\n**Celebrity capital** is defined as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations, exchanged within celebrity endorsement for economic and social capital. Traditional celebrities gain this capital through institutional intermediaries, while SMIs gain popularity independently, often becoming famous for being famous online.\n\nThis study addresses the gap in understanding how SMIs acquire celebrity capital and the role of advertising practitioners in this process.\n\nImportantly, social media's impact extends beyond celebrity culture, influencing broader communication patterns. It fosters new interaction norms characterized by immediacy, multimodality (text, image, video), and informal language styles. These shifts affect interpersonal communication by encouraging more visual and emotive expression, altering language use with emojis, memes, and internet slang, and redefining community engagement through virtual groups and participatory cultures.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Influencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\n\n- Celebrities function as both commodities and laborers, promoting brands by leveraging media visibility and personalities.\n- Celebrity capital is a sociocultural currency convertible into economic resources, especially through endorsements.\n- The **celebrity capital life cycle** includes four stages: acquisition, consolidation, downfall/decline, and redemption/resurgence.\n- Most research focuses on consolidation (peak fame), but acquisition (growing visibility) is critical for understanding influencers.\n- Unlike traditional celebrities, influencers build fame through direct audience engagement and content creation without institutional gatekeepers.\n\n### Celebrification in the Digital Age\n\n- **Celebrification** is the mediated process of producing and reproducing celebrity status.\n- Traditional celebrification was controlled by media gatekeepers; social media democratizes this, allowing everyday people to gain celebrity capital.\n- Celebrity capital exists on a continuum and can be fleeting or involuntary (e.g., memes).\n- Influencers navigate a complex, evolving media landscape with multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- Celebrification now involves both content and community, with influencers acting as microcelebrities or branded social media stars.\n\nBeyond celebrification, social media transforms societal communication dynamics by fostering new interaction norms. The platform architectures encourage rapid, asynchronous exchanges, blending public and private communication spheres. Language use adapts to these environments, with increased use of paralinguistic features like emojis and GIFs to convey tone and emotion, compensating for the lack of face-to-face cues. These changes influence how communities form and sustain themselves, often around shared interests or identities, enabling more participatory and decentralized communication.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1. Generative Practices  \n- **Attention Labor:** Influencers invest entrepreneurial effort to attract and maintain audience attention by producing authentic content and engaging emotionally with followers.  \n- **Platform Agnosticism:** Influencers translate their unique content across multiple social media platforms, ensuring longevity beyond any single platform.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, identifying influencers who have already begun self-celebrification.*\n\n### 2. Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\nBeyond these practices, social media also influences interpersonal communication by shaping how influencers and their communities interact. The norms of immediacy, conversational tone, and multimodal expression foster a sense of intimacy and accessibility, blurring traditional boundaries between public figures and audiences. This dynamic interaction style contributes to the co-creation of meaning and identity within digital communities, reflecting broader shifts in societal communication patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\nThis model also implicitly captures how social media platforms mediate new communication styles and interaction norms, facilitating community engagement that transcends traditional media boundaries. The iterative practices reflect evolving communication dynamics where language, interaction, and community participation are continuously negotiated.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores social media's broader impact on communication styles and societal interaction norms. The platform-driven shift toward informal, multimodal, and participatory communication challenges traditional models of interpersonal and mass communication. This transformation affects language use, interaction rhythms, and community formation, suggesting that social media is not only a marketing tool but a fundamental agent of communicative change.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the evolving communication norms on social media can help practitioners design campaigns that resonate authentically with audiences, fostering deeper engagement and community loyalty.

      "final_answer": "To increase engagement on social media effectively, brands and individuals should focus on several key strategies:\n\n1. **Create Authentic and Relatable Content**: Audiences respond better to genuine stories, behind-the-scenes moments, and honest communication rather than overly polished or sales-driven posts. Authenticity helps build trust and deeper connections with followers [7].\n\n2. **Encourage Interaction Through Interactive Features**: Using tools like Instagram Story surveys, polls, quizzes, and question stickers invites followers to participate actively, increasing engagement rates. These formats are easy for users to interact with and can also provide valuable insights for the brand [9].\n\n3. **Respond and Engage with Your Audience**: Social media is a two-way street. Replying to comments, answering direct messages, and joining relevant conversations show that the brand values its community, turning followers into loyal fans [7][6].\n\n4. **Analyze and Replicate Best-Performing Content**: Use social media analytics and benchmarking tools to identify which types of posts resonate most with your audience. Replicating successful content pillars can help maintain and grow engagement [2].\n\n5. **Leverage Influencer and User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Collaborating with influencers or encouraging followers to create content related to your brand can amplify reach and foster organic engagement. Influencers also bring celebrity capital that can boost brand visibility [6][10].\n\n6. **Consistency and Timing**: Posting regularly and at times when your audience is most active helps keep your brand top of mind and maximizes the chances of interaction [7].\n\n7. **Use Calls to Action (CTAs)**: Prompt your audience to like, comment, share, or save your posts. Clear CTAs guide followers on how to engage and can significantly increase interaction rates [8].\n\nBy combining these approaches—authentic storytelling, interactive content, active community management, data-driven content strategy, influencer partnerships, and consistent posting—brands can effectively increase social media engagement and build meaningful relationships with their audience [6][7][8][9].",
      "modified_content": "Full article: Influencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital  \n---\n\n# Influencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital\n\n**Authors:**  \nGillian Brooks (King’s College London)  \nJenna Drenten (Loyola University Chicago)  \nMikolaj Jan Piskorski (International Institute for Management Development)  \n\n**Published online:** 22 November 2021  \n**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737  \n\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe digital age has created new pathways for everyday individuals to gain media attention, convertible into promotional opportunities. This sociocultural currency, known as **celebrity capital**, was traditionally acquired through institutional intermediaries like sports, television, music, and movies. Social media influencers (SMIs), however, acquire celebrity capital differently, bypassing such intermediaries. Based on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers, this study conceptualizes **influencer celebrification**—the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. This process involves three iterative practices: generative, collaborative, and evaluative. Advertising practitioners play key roles as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts. The study offers implications for advertising theory and practice.\n\nBeyond influencer marketing and celebrity capital acquisition, social media profoundly influences interpersonal communication patterns, language use, and societal communication dynamics. It reshapes communication styles, interaction norms, and community engagement, thereby altering how individuals and groups connect and communicate in contemporary society.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nCharli D’Amelio exemplifies a new generation of Internet fame, amassing over 40 million TikTok followers and nearly 12 million Instagram followers by age 15. Her fame translated into commercial success through contracts, branded products, and reality TV. This reflects the rise of influencer culture, where everyday people gain media attention and convert it into celebrity capital for endorsements.\n\n**Celebrity capital** is defined as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations, exchanged within celebrity endorsement for economic and social capital. Traditional celebrities gain this capital through institutional intermediaries, while SMIs gain popularity independently, often becoming famous for being famous online.\n\nThis study addresses the gap in understanding how SMIs acquire celebrity capital and the role of advertising practitioners in this process.\n\nImportantly, social media's impact extends beyond celebrity culture, influencing broader communication patterns. It fosters new interaction norms characterized by immediacy, multimodality (text, image, video), and informal language styles. These shifts affect interpersonal communication by encouraging more visual and emotive expression, altering language use with emojis, memes, and internet slang, and redefining community engagement through virtual groups and participatory cultures.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Influencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\n\n- Celebrities function as both commodities and laborers, promoting brands by leveraging media visibility and personalities.\n- Celebrity capital is a sociocultural currency convertible into economic resources, especially through endorsements.\n- The **celebrity capital life cycle** includes four stages: acquisition, consolidation, downfall/decline, and redemption/resurgence.\n- Most research focuses on consolidation (peak fame), but acquisition (growing visibility) is critical for understanding influencers.\n- Unlike traditional celebrities, influencers build fame through direct audience engagement and content creation without institutional gatekeepers.\n\n### Celebrification in the Digital Age\n\n- **Celebrification** is the mediated process of producing and reproducing celebrity status.\n- Traditional celebrification was controlled by media gatekeepers; social media democratizes this, allowing everyday people to gain celebrity capital.\n- Celebrity capital exists on a continuum and can be fleeting or involuntary (e.g., memes).\n- Influencers navigate a complex, evolving media landscape with multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- Celebrification now involves both content and community, with influencers acting as microcelebrities or branded social media stars.\n\nBeyond celebrification, social media transforms societal communication dynamics by fostering new interaction norms. The platform architectures encourage rapid, asynchronous exchanges, blending public and private communication spheres. Language use adapts to these environments, with increased use of paralinguistic features like emojis and GIFs to convey tone and emotion, compensating for the lack of face-to-face cues. These changes influence how communities form and sustain themselves, often around shared interests or identities, enabling more participatory and decentralized communication.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1. Generative Practices  \n- **Attention Labor:** Influencers invest entrepreneurial effort to attract and maintain audience attention by producing authentic content and engaging emotionally with followers.  \n- **Platform Agnosticism:** Influencers translate their unique content across multiple social media platforms, ensuring longevity beyond any single platform.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, identifying influencers who have already begun self-celebrification.*\n\n### 2. Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\nBeyond these practices, social media also influences interpersonal communication by shaping how influencers and their communities interact. The norms of immediacy, conversational tone, and multimodal expression foster a sense of intimacy and accessibility, blurring traditional boundaries between public figures and audiences. This dynamic interaction style contributes to the co-creation of meaning and identity within digital communities, reflecting broader shifts in societal communication patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\nThis model also implicitly captures how social media platforms mediate new communication styles and interaction norms, facilitating community engagement that transcends traditional media boundaries. The iterative practices reflect evolving communication dynamics where language, interaction, and community participation are continuously negotiated.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores social media's broader impact on communication styles and societal interaction norms. The platform-driven shift toward informal, multimodal, and participatory communication challenges traditional models of interpersonal and mass communication. This transformation affects language use, interaction rhythms, and community formation, suggesting that social media is not only a marketing tool but a fundamental agent of communicative change.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the evolving communication norms on social media can help practitioners design campaigns that resonate authentically with audiences, fostering deeper engagement and community loyalty. Recognizing the role of language innovation, interaction styles, and community dynamics is essential for effective influencer marketing and broader communication strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Influencer Platforms: Features, User Experience, and Benefits\n\nIn the evolving ecosystem of influencer celebrification, digital influencer platforms have become essential tools for both brands and influencers. These platforms facilitate influencer discovery, campaign management, and analytics, thereby supporting the generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices central to acquiring celebrity capital.\n\n### Overview of Top Digital Influencer Platforms\n\nSeveral leading platforms exemplify the integration of features that align with the influencer celebrification process:\n\n- **Upfluence:** Offers comprehensive influencer search with filters based on demographics, engagement rates, and audience insights.

      "final_answer": "Celebrity capital consulting services typically refer to specialized advisory offerings that help individuals—especially celebrities, influencers, and high-profile talent—leverage their fame and social media presence into strategic business, branding, and financial opportunities. This concept is closely tied to the idea of \"celebrity capital,\" a form of sociocultural currency that influencers and celebrities accumulate and convert into promotional and commercial value without relying solely on traditional media intermediaries like TV or film industries [11].\n\nOne example of such consulting is found in firms that connect brands and events with high-profile celebrities and influencers to create impactful campaigns and experiences, particularly in regions like the Middle East. These firms act as access points to a wide talent pool, including celebrities, artists, and thought leaders, facilitating collaborations that enhance brand visibility and engagement [2].\n\nOn the financial side, boutique consulting firms offer services tailored to ultra-high-net-worth individuals, including celebrities, focusing on tax efficiency, wealth preservation, and legacy planning. These services address complex financial events such as capital gains tax on asset sales, passive income taxation, and estate tax reduction, working closely with clients’ legal and tax advisors to optimize financial outcomes [4].\n\nIn summary, celebrity capital consulting services encompass strategic brand and event management leveraging celebrity influence, as well as specialized financial and tax advisory services designed to maximize the economic benefits of celebrity status and wealth [2][4][11].",

These changes influence how communities form and sustain themselves, often around shared interests or identities, enabling more participatory and decentralized communication.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1. Generative Practices  \n- **Attention Labor:** Influencers invest entrepreneurial effort to attract and maintain audience attention by producing authentic content and engaging emotionally with followers.  \n- **Platform Agnosticism:** Influencers translate their unique content across multiple social media platforms, ensuring longevity beyond any single platform.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, identifying influencers who have already begun self-celebrification.*\n\n### 2. Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\nBeyond these practices, social media also influences interpersonal communication by shaping how influencers and their communities interact. The norms of immediacy, conversational tone, and multimodal expression foster a sense of intimacy and accessibility, blurring traditional boundaries between public figures and audiences. This dynamic interaction style contributes to the co-creation of meaning and identity within digital communities, reflecting broader shifts in societal communication patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\nThis model also implicitly captures how social media platforms mediate new communication styles and interaction norms, facilitating community engagement that transcends traditional media boundaries. The iterative practices reflect evolving communication dynamics where language, interaction, and community participation are continuously negotiated.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores social media's broader impact on communication styles and societal interaction norms. The platform-driven shift toward informal, multimodal, and participatory communication challenges traditional models of interpersonal and mass communication. This transformation affects language use, interaction rhythms, and community formation, suggesting that social media is not only a marketing tool but a fundamental agent of communicative change.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the evolving communication norms on social media can help practitioners design campaigns that resonate authentically with audiences, fostering deeper engagement and community loyalty. Recognizing the role of language innovation, interaction styles, and community dynamics is essential for effective influencer marketing and broader communication strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Influencer Platforms: Features, User Experience, and Benefits\n\nIn the evolving ecosystem of influencer celebrification, digital influencer platforms have become essential tools for both brands and influencers.

      "modified_content": "Full article: Influencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital  \n---\n\n# Influencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital\n\n**Authors:**  \nGillian Brooks (King’s College London)  \nJenna Drenten (Loyola University Chicago)  \nMikolaj Jan Piskorski (International Institute for Management Development)  \n\n**Published online:** 22 November 2021  \n**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737  \n\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe digital age has created new pathways for everyday individuals to gain media attention, convertible into promotional opportunities. This sociocultural currency, known as **celebrity capital**, was traditionally acquired through institutional intermediaries like sports, television, music, and movies. Social media influencers (SMIs), however, acquire celebrity capital differently, bypassing such intermediaries. Based on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers, this study conceptualizes **influencer celebrification**—the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. This process involves three iterative practices: generative, collaborative, and evaluative. Advertising practitioners play key roles as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts. The study offers implications for advertising theory and practice.\n\nBeyond influencer marketing and celebrity capital acquisition, social media profoundly influences interpersonal communication patterns, language use, and societal communication dynamics. It reshapes communication styles, interaction norms, and community engagement, thereby altering how individuals and groups connect and communicate in contemporary society.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nCharli D’Amelio exemplifies a new generation of Internet fame, amassing over 40 million TikTok followers and nearly 12 million Instagram followers by age 15. Her fame translated into commercial success through contracts, branded products, and reality TV. This reflects the rise of influencer culture, where everyday people gain media attention and convert it into celebrity capital for endorsements.\n\n**Celebrity capital** is defined as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations, exchanged within celebrity endorsement for economic and social capital. Traditional celebrities gain this capital through institutional intermediaries, while SMIs gain popularity independently, often becoming famous for being famous online.\n\nThis study addresses the gap in understanding how SMIs acquire celebrity capital and the role of advertising practitioners in this process.\n\nImportantly, social media's impact extends beyond celebrity culture, influencing broader communication patterns. It fosters new interaction norms characterized by immediacy, multimodality (text, image, video), and informal language styles. These shifts affect interpersonal communication by encouraging more visual and emotive expression, altering language use with emojis, memes, and internet slang, and redefining community engagement through virtual groups and participatory cultures.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Influencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\n\n- Celebrities function as both commodities and laborers, promoting brands by leveraging media visibility and personalities.\n- Celebrity capital is a sociocultural currency convertible into economic resources, especially through endorsements.\n- The **celebrity capital life cycle** includes four stages: acquisition, consolidation, downfall/decline, and redemption/resurgence.\n- Most research focuses on consolidation (peak fame), but acquisition (growing visibility) is critical for understanding influencers.\n- Unlike traditional celebrities, influencers build fame through direct audience engagement and content creation without institutional gatekeepers.\n\n### Celebrification in the Digital Age\n\n- **Celebrification** is the mediated process of producing and reproducing celebrity status.\n- Traditional celebrification was controlled by media gatekeepers; social media democratizes this, allowing everyday people to gain celebrity capital.\n- Celebrity capital exists on a continuum and can be fleeting or involuntary (e.g., memes).\n- Influencers navigate a complex, evolving media landscape with multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- Celebrification now involves both content and community, with influencers acting as microcelebrities or branded social media stars.\n\nBeyond celebrification, social media transforms societal communication dynamics by fostering new interaction norms. The platform architectures encourage rapid, asynchronous exchanges, blending public and private communication spheres. Language use adapts to these environments, with increased use of paralinguistic features like emojis and GIFs to convey tone and emotion, compensating for the lack of face-to-face cues. These changes influence how communities form and sustain themselves, often around shared interests or identities, enabling more participatory and decentralized communication.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1.

For academic and conceptual insights into how social media influencers acquire celebrity status (celebrity capital), the study \"Influencer Celebrification\" by Brooks, Drenten, and Piskorski offers a scholarly perspective. While not a YouTube channel, this research can inform content creation for channels focusing on influencer celebrity case studies [6].\n\nTo find YouTube channels specifically dedicated to celebrity influencer case studies, searching for terms like “celebrity influencer marketing case studies,” “influencer campaign breakdowns,” or “celebrity influencer success stories” on YouTube is recommended. Channels affiliated with influencer marketing platforms or digital marketing educators often post such content.\n\nIn summary, while no single dedicated YouTube channel for celebrity influencer case studies is explicitly identified in the search results, platforms like Influencer Marketing Hub, GRIN, and experts like Neal Schaffer provide rich case study content that is often adapted into video format suitable for YouTube audiences [1][4][5].",
      "modified_content": "Full article: Influencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital  \n---\n\n# Influencer Celebrification: How Social Media Influencers Acquire Celebrity Capital\n\n**Authors:**  \nGillian Brooks (King’s College London)  \nJenna Drenten (Loyola University Chicago)  \nMikolaj Jan Piskorski (International Institute for Management Development)  \n\n**Published online:** 22 November 2021  \n**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2021.1977737  \n\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe digital age has created new pathways for everyday individuals to gain media attention, convertible into promotional opportunities. This sociocultural currency, known as **celebrity capital**, was traditionally acquired through institutional intermediaries like sports, television, music, and movies. Social media influencers (SMIs), however, acquire celebrity capital differently, bypassing such intermediaries. Based on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers, this study conceptualizes **influencer celebrification**—the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. This process involves three iterative practices: generative, collaborative, and evaluative. Advertising practitioners play key roles as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts. The study offers implications for advertising theory and practice.\n\nBeyond influencer marketing and celebrity capital acquisition, social media profoundly influences interpersonal communication patterns, language use, and societal communication dynamics. It reshapes communication styles, interaction norms, and community engagement, thereby altering how individuals and groups connect and communicate in contemporary society.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nCharli D’Amelio exemplifies a new generation of Internet fame, amassing over 40 million TikTok followers and nearly 12 million Instagram followers by age 15. Her fame translated into commercial success through contracts, branded products, and reality TV. This reflects the rise of influencer culture, where everyday people gain media attention and convert it into celebrity capital for endorsements.\n\n**Celebrity capital** is defined as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations, exchanged within celebrity endorsement for economic and social capital. Traditional celebrities gain this capital through institutional intermediaries, while SMIs gain popularity independently, often becoming famous for being famous online.\n\nThis study addresses the gap in understanding how SMIs acquire celebrity capital and the role of advertising practitioners in this process.\n\nImportantly, social media's impact extends beyond celebrity culture, influencing broader communication patterns. It fosters new interaction norms characterized by immediacy, multimodality (text, image, video), and informal language styles. These shifts affect interpersonal communication by encouraging more visual and emotive expression, altering language use with emojis, memes, and internet slang, and redefining community engagement through virtual groups and participatory cultures.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Influencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\n\n- Celebrities function as both commodities and laborers, promoting brands by leveraging media visibility and personalities.\n- Celebrity capital is a sociocultural currency convertible into economic resources, especially through endorsements.\n- The **celebrity capital life cycle** includes four stages: acquisition, consolidation, downfall/decline, and redemption/resurgence.\n- Most research focuses on consolidation (peak fame), but acquisition (growing visibility) is critical for understanding influencers.\n- Unlike traditional celebrities, influencers build fame through direct audience engagement and content creation without institutional gatekeepers.\n\n### Celebrification in the Digital Age\n\n- **Celebrification** is the mediated process of producing and reproducing celebrity status.\n- Traditional celebrification was controlled by media gatekeepers; social media democratizes this, allowing everyday people to gain celebrity capital.\n- Celebrity capital exists on a continuum and can be fleeting or involuntary (e.g., memes).\n- Influencers navigate a complex, evolving media landscape with multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- Celebrification now involves both content and community, with influencers acting as microcelebrities or branded social media stars.\n\nBeyond celebrification, social media transforms societal communication dynamics by fostering new interaction norms. The platform architectures encourage rapid, asynchronous exchanges, blending public and private communication spheres. Language use adapts to these environments, with increased use of paralinguistic features like emojis and GIFs to convey tone and emotion, compensating for the lack of face-to-face cues. These changes influence how communities form and sustain themselves, often around shared interests or identities, enabling more participatory and decentralized communication.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1. Generative Practices  \n- **Attention Labor:** Influencers invest entrepreneurial effort to attract and maintain audience attention by producing authentic content and engaging emotionally with followers.  \n- **Platform Agnosticism:** Influencers translate their unique content across multiple social media platforms, ensuring longevity beyond any single platform.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, identifying influencers who have already begun self-celebrification.*\n\n### 2. Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\nBeyond these practices, social media also influences interpersonal communication by shaping how influencers and their communities interact. The norms of immediacy, conversational tone, and multimodal expression foster a sense of intimacy and accessibility, blurring traditional boundaries between public figures and audiences. This dynamic interaction style contributes to the co-creation of meaning and identity within digital communities, reflecting broader shifts in societal communication patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\nThis model also implicitly captures how social media platforms mediate new communication styles and interaction norms, facilitating community engagement that transcends traditional media boundaries. The iterative practices reflect evolving communication dynamics where language, interaction, and community participation are continuously negotiated.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores social media's broader impact on communication styles and societal interaction norms. The platform-driven shift toward informal, multimodal, and participatory communication challenges traditional models of interpersonal and mass communication. This transformation affects language use, interaction rhythms, and community formation, suggesting that social media is not only a marketing tool but a fundamental agent of communicative change.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the evolving communication norms on social media can help practitioners design campaigns that resonate authentically with audiences, fostering deeper engagement and community loyalty. Recognizing the role of language innovation, interaction styles, and community dynamics is essential for effective influencer marketing and broader communication strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Influencer Platforms: Features, User Experience, and Benefits\n\nIn the evolving ecosystem of influencer celebrification, digital influencer platforms have become essential tools for both brands and influencers.

This sociocultural currency, known as **celebrity capital**, was traditionally acquired through institutional intermediaries like sports, television, music, and movies. Social media influencers (SMIs), however, acquire celebrity capital differently, bypassing such intermediaries. Based on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers, this study conceptualizes **influencer celebrification**—the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. This process involves three iterative practices: generative, collaborative, and evaluative. Advertising practitioners play key roles as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts. The study offers implications for advertising theory and practice.\n\nBeyond influencer marketing and celebrity capital acquisition, social media profoundly influences interpersonal communication patterns, language use, and societal communication dynamics. It reshapes communication styles, interaction norms, and community engagement, thereby altering how individuals and groups connect and communicate in contemporary society.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nCharli D’Amelio exemplifies a new generation of Internet fame, amassing over 40 million TikTok followers and nearly 12 million Instagram followers by age 15. Her fame translated into commercial success through contracts, branded products, and reality TV. This reflects the rise of influencer culture, where everyday people gain media attention and convert it into celebrity capital for endorsements.\n\n**Celebrity capital** is defined as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations, exchanged within celebrity endorsement for economic and social capital. Traditional celebrities gain this capital through institutional intermediaries, while SMIs gain popularity independently, often becoming famous for being famous online.\n\nThis study addresses the gap in understanding how SMIs acquire celebrity capital and the role of advertising practitioners in this process.\n\nImportantly, social media's impact extends beyond celebrity culture, influencing broader communication patterns. It fosters new interaction norms characterized by immediacy, multimodality (text, image, video), and informal language styles. These shifts affect interpersonal communication by encouraging more visual and emotive expression, altering language use with emojis, memes, and internet slang, and redefining community engagement through virtual groups and participatory cultures.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Influencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\n\n- Celebrities function as both commodities and laborers, promoting brands by leveraging media visibility and personalities.\n- Celebrity capital is a sociocultural currency convertible into economic resources, especially through endorsements.\n- The **celebrity capital life cycle** includes four stages: acquisition, consolidation, downfall/decline, and redemption/resurgence.\n- Most research focuses on consolidation (peak fame), but acquisition (growing visibility) is critical for understanding influencers.\n- Unlike traditional celebrities, influencers build fame through direct audience engagement and content creation without institutional gatekeepers.\n\n### Celebrification in the Digital Age\n\n- **Celebrification** is the mediated process of producing and reproducing celebrity status.\n- Traditional celebrification was controlled by media gatekeepers; social media democratizes this, allowing everyday people to gain celebrity capital.\n- Celebrity capital exists on a continuum and can be fleeting or involuntary (e.g., memes).\n- Influencers navigate a complex, evolving media landscape with multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- Celebrification now involves both content and community, with influencers acting as microcelebrities or branded social media stars.\n\nBeyond celebrification, social media transforms societal communication dynamics by fostering new interaction norms. The platform architectures encourage rapid, asynchronous exchanges, blending public and private communication spheres. Language use adapts to these environments, with increased use of paralinguistic features like emojis and GIFs to convey tone and emotion, compensating for the lack of face-to-face cues. These changes influence how communities form and sustain themselves, often around shared interests or identities, enabling more participatory and decentralized communication.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1. Generative Practices  \n- **Attention Labor:** Influencers invest entrepreneurial effort to attract and maintain audience attention by producing authentic content and engaging emotionally with followers.  \n- **Platform Agnosticism:** Influencers translate their unique content across multiple social media platforms, ensuring longevity beyond any single platform.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, identifying influencers who have already begun self-celebrification.*\n\n### 2. Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\nBeyond these practices, social media also influences interpersonal communication by shaping how influencers and their communities interact. The norms of immediacy, conversational tone, and multimodal expression foster a sense of intimacy and accessibility, blurring traditional boundaries between public figures and audiences. This dynamic interaction style contributes to the co-creation of meaning and identity within digital communities, reflecting broader shifts in societal communication patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\nThis model also implicitly captures how social media platforms mediate new communication styles and interaction norms, facilitating community engagement that transcends traditional media boundaries. The iterative practices reflect evolving communication dynamics where language, interaction, and community participation are continuously negotiated.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores social media's broader impact on communication styles and societal interaction norms. The platform-driven shift toward informal, multimodal, and participatory communication challenges traditional models of interpersonal and mass communication. This transformation affects language use, interaction rhythms, and community formation, suggesting that social media is not only a marketing tool but a fundamental agent of communicative change.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the evolving communication norms on social media can help practitioners design campaigns that resonate authentically with audiences, fostering deeper engagement and community loyalty. Recognizing the role of language innovation, interaction styles, and community dynamics is essential for effective influencer marketing and broader communication strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Influencer Platforms: Features, User Experience, and Benefits\n\nIn the evolving ecosystem of influencer celebrification, digital influencer platforms have become essential tools for both brands and influencers. These platforms facilitate influencer discovery, campaign management, and analytics, thereby supporting the generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices central to acquiring celebrity capital.\n\n### Overview of Top Digital Influencer Platforms\n\nSeveral leading platforms exemplify the integration of features that align with the influencer celebrification process:\n\n- **Upfluence:** Offers comprehensive influencer search with filters based on demographics, engagement rates, and audience insights.

The iterative practices reflect evolving communication dynamics where language, interaction, and community participation are continuously negotiated.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores social media's broader impact on communication styles and societal interaction norms. The platform-driven shift toward informal, multimodal, and participatory communication challenges traditional models of interpersonal and mass communication. This transformation affects language use, interaction rhythms, and community formation, suggesting that social media is not only a marketing tool but a fundamental agent of communicative change.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the evolving communication norms on social media can help practitioners design campaigns that resonate authentically with audiences, fostering deeper engagement and community loyalty. Recognizing the role of language innovation, interaction styles, and community dynamics is essential for effective influencer marketing and broader communication strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Influencer Platforms: Features, User Experience, and Benefits\n\nIn the evolving ecosystem of influencer celebrification, digital influencer platforms have become essential tools for both brands and influencers.

This sociocultural currency, known as **celebrity capital**, was traditionally acquired through institutional intermediaries like sports, television, music, and movies. Social media influencers (SMIs), however, acquire celebrity capital differently, bypassing such intermediaries. Based on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers, this study conceptualizes **influencer celebrification**—the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. This process involves three iterative practices: generative, collaborative, and evaluative. Advertising practitioners play key roles as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts. The study offers implications for advertising theory and practice.\n\nBeyond influencer marketing and celebrity capital acquisition, social media profoundly influences interpersonal communication patterns, language use, and societal communication dynamics. It reshapes communication styles, interaction norms, and community engagement, thereby altering how individuals and groups connect and communicate in contemporary society.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nCharli D’Amelio exemplifies a new generation of Internet fame, amassing over 40 million TikTok followers and nearly 12 million Instagram followers by age 15. Her fame translated into commercial success through contracts, branded products, and reality TV. This reflects the rise of influencer culture, where everyday people gain media attention and convert it into celebrity capital for endorsements.\n\n**Celebrity capital** is defined as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations, exchanged within celebrity endorsement for economic and social capital. Traditional celebrities gain this capital through institutional intermediaries, while SMIs gain popularity independently, often becoming famous for being famous online.\n\nThis study addresses the gap in understanding how SMIs acquire celebrity capital and the role of advertising practitioners in this process.\n\nImportantly, social media's impact extends beyond celebrity culture, influencing broader communication patterns. It fosters new interaction norms characterized by immediacy, multimodality (text, image, video), and informal language styles. These shifts affect interpersonal communication by encouraging more visual and emotive expression, altering language use with emojis, memes, and internet slang, and redefining community engagement through virtual groups and participatory cultures.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Influencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\n\n- Celebrities function as both commodities and laborers, promoting brands by leveraging media visibility and personalities.\n- Celebrity capital is a sociocultural currency convertible into economic resources, especially through endorsements.\n- The **celebrity capital life cycle** includes four stages: acquisition, consolidation, downfall/decline, and redemption/resurgence.\n- Most research focuses on consolidation (peak fame), but acquisition (growing visibility) is critical for understanding influencers.\n- Unlike traditional celebrities, influencers build fame through direct audience engagement and content creation without institutional gatekeepers.\n\n### Celebrification in the Digital Age\n\n- **Celebrification** is the mediated process of producing and reproducing celebrity status.\n- Traditional celebrification was controlled by media gatekeepers; social media democratizes this, allowing everyday people to gain celebrity capital.\n- Celebrity capital exists on a continuum and can be fleeting or involuntary (e.g., memes).\n- Influencers navigate a complex, evolving media landscape with multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- Celebrification now involves both content and community, with influencers acting as microcelebrities or branded social media stars.\n\nBeyond celebrification, social media transforms societal communication dynamics by fostering new interaction norms. The platform architectures encourage rapid, asynchronous exchanges, blending public and private communication spheres. Language use adapts to these environments, with increased use of paralinguistic features like emojis and GIFs to convey tone and emotion, compensating for the lack of face-to-face cues. These changes influence how communities form and sustain themselves, often around shared interests or identities, enabling more participatory and decentralized communication.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1. Generative Practices  \n- **Attention Labor:** Influencers invest entrepreneurial effort to attract and maintain audience attention by producing authentic content and engaging emotionally with followers.  \n- **Platform Agnosticism:** Influencers translate their unique content across multiple social media platforms, ensuring longevity beyond any single platform.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, identifying influencers who have already begun self-celebrification.*\n\n### 2. Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\nBeyond these practices, social media also influences interpersonal communication by shaping how influencers and their communities interact. The norms of immediacy, conversational tone, and multimodal expression foster a sense of intimacy and accessibility, blurring traditional boundaries between public figures and audiences. This dynamic interaction style contributes to the co-creation of meaning and identity within digital communities, reflecting broader shifts in societal communication patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\nThis model also implicitly captures how social media platforms mediate new communication styles and interaction norms, facilitating community engagement that transcends traditional media boundaries. The iterative practices reflect evolving communication dynamics where language, interaction, and community participation are continuously negotiated.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores social media's broader impact on communication styles and societal interaction norms. The platform-driven shift toward informal, multimodal, and participatory communication challenges traditional models of interpersonal and mass communication. This transformation affects language use, interaction rhythms, and community formation, suggesting that social media is not only a marketing tool but a fundamental agent of communicative change.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the evolving communication norms on social media can help practitioners design campaigns that resonate authentically with audiences, fostering deeper engagement and community loyalty. Recognizing the role of language innovation, interaction styles, and community dynamics is essential for effective influencer marketing and broader communication strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Influencer Platforms: Features, User Experience, and Benefits\n\nIn the evolving ecosystem of influencer celebrification, digital influencer platforms have become essential tools for both brands and influencers.

Traditional celebrities gain this capital through institutional intermediaries, while SMIs gain popularity independently, often becoming famous for being famous online.\n\nThis study addresses the gap in understanding how SMIs acquire celebrity capital and the role of advertising practitioners in this process.\n\nImportantly, social media's impact extends beyond celebrity culture, influencing broader communication patterns. It fosters new interaction norms characterized by immediacy, multimodality (text, image, video), and informal language styles. These shifts affect interpersonal communication by encouraging more visual and emotive expression, altering language use with emojis, memes, and internet slang, and redefining community engagement through virtual groups and participatory cultures.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\n### Influencer Advertising and the Celebrity Capital Life Cycle\n\n- Celebrities function as both commodities and laborers, promoting brands by leveraging media visibility and personalities.\n- Celebrity capital is a sociocultural currency convertible into economic resources, especially through endorsements.\n- The **celebrity capital life cycle** includes four stages: acquisition, consolidation, downfall/decline, and redemption/resurgence.\n- Most research focuses on consolidation (peak fame), but acquisition (growing visibility) is critical for understanding influencers.\n- Unlike traditional celebrities, influencers build fame through direct audience engagement and content creation without institutional gatekeepers.\n\n### Celebrification in the Digital Age\n\n- **Celebrification** is the mediated process of producing and reproducing celebrity status.\n- Traditional celebrification was controlled by media gatekeepers; social media democratizes this, allowing everyday people to gain celebrity capital.\n- Celebrity capital exists on a continuum and can be fleeting or involuntary (e.g., memes).\n- Influencers navigate a complex, evolving media landscape with multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- Celebrification now involves both content and community, with influencers acting as microcelebrities or branded social media stars.\n\nBeyond celebrification, social media transforms societal communication dynamics by fostering new interaction norms. The platform architectures encourage rapid, asynchronous exchanges, blending public and private communication spheres. Language use adapts to these environments, with increased use of paralinguistic features like emojis and GIFs to convey tone and emotion, compensating for the lack of face-to-face cues. These changes influence how communities form and sustain themselves, often around shared interests or identities, enabling more participatory and decentralized communication.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\n- A **grounded theory** approach was used, involving 40 in-depth interviews across seven cities (Cincinnati, London, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Toronto, New York).\n- Participants included 5 high-profile influencers, 7 talent agents, 5 brand executives, 17 public relations and digital analytics practitioners, and 6 industry experts.\n- Influencers ranged from 100,000 to over 2 million followers and had partnerships with major brands.\n- Interviews lasted 1-2 hours, were semi-structured, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through iterative coding (initial, open, axial, selective).\n- Analytical memos and diagrams supported theoretical saturation and framework development.\n\n---\n\n## Findings: The Influencer Celebrification Process\n\n**Influencer celebrification** is the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital through three iterative practices:\n\n### 1. Generative Practices  \n- **Attention Labor:** Influencers invest entrepreneurial effort to attract and maintain audience attention by producing authentic content and engaging emotionally with followers.  \n- **Platform Agnosticism:** Influencers translate their unique content across multiple social media platforms, ensuring longevity beyond any single platform.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as talent scouts, identifying influencers who have already begun self-celebrification.*\n\n### 2. Collaborative Practices  \n- **Audience Portability:** Influencers transport their audience across platforms and brand partnerships, expanding their celebrity capital.  \n- **Creative Ideation:** Content creation is a reciprocal process between influencers and their audiences, with influencers sharing creative control to maintain authenticity and engagement.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners serve as creative concierges, facilitating collaborations and expanding opportunities.*\n\n### 3. Evaluative Practices  \n- **Community-Centric KPIs:** Celebrity capital is legitimized by qualitative measures of audience commitment and community engagement, beyond mere follower counts.  \n- **Content Traversal:** Tracking how influencer content spreads across platforms and media, assessing reach and impact in real time.  \n\n*Advertising practitioners act as impact analysts, evaluating influencer relevance and success potential.*\n\nBeyond these practices, social media also influences interpersonal communication by shaping how influencers and their communities interact. The norms of immediacy, conversational tone, and multimodal expression foster a sense of intimacy and accessibility, blurring traditional boundaries between public figures and audiences. This dynamic interaction style contributes to the co-creation of meaning and identity within digital communities, reflecting broader shifts in societal communication patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Conceptual Model\n\n- Influencer celebrification is synergistic: the combined effect of generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices exceeds the sum of individual effects.\n- Community-oriented synergistic effects arise from attention labor, audience portability, and community-centric KPIs.\n- Content-oriented synergistic effects arise from platform agnosticism, creative ideation, and content traversal.\n\nThis model also implicitly captures how social media platforms mediate new communication styles and interaction norms, facilitating community engagement that transcends traditional media boundaries. The iterative practices reflect evolving communication dynamics where language, interaction, and community participation are continuously negotiated.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\n- Influencers acquire celebrity capital differently from traditional celebrities, emphasizing direct audience interaction and community engagement.\n- Existing celebrity endorsement theories may not fully capture influencer dynamics; new frameworks grounded in influencer culture are needed.\n- The audience plays an active role in celebrification, spreading content and shaping influencer success.\n- The process-oriented nature of influencer celebrification highlights the \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\" of celebrity.\n- Future research should explore maintenance and loss of celebrity capital, algorithmic biases, and cross-cultural differences.\n\nMoreover, the study underscores social media's broader impact on communication styles and societal interaction norms. The platform-driven shift toward informal, multimodal, and participatory communication challenges traditional models of interpersonal and mass communication. This transformation affects language use, interaction rhythms, and community formation, suggesting that social media is not only a marketing tool but a fundamental agent of communicative change.\n\n### Practical Implications\n\n- Advertising practitioners must balance supporting influencer authenticity with leveraging celebrity capital commercially.\n- Influencers are experts in their medium and should be collaborators, not just hired endorsers.\n- Practitioners can identify potential influencers within brand employees and expand influencer advertising beyond single platforms.\n- Measurement of influencer success should move beyond traditional metrics to community-driven KPIs.\n- The influencer advertising industry is professionalizing, requiring specialized skills distinct from general social media advertising.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the evolving communication norms on social media can help practitioners design campaigns that resonate authentically with audiences, fostering deeper engagement and community loyalty. Recognizing the role of language innovation, interaction styles, and community dynamics is essential for effective influencer marketing and broader communication strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Influencer Platforms: Features, User Experience, and Benefits\n\nIn the evolving ecosystem of influencer celebrification, digital influencer platforms have become essential tools for both brands and influencers.

      "final_answer": "There are no direct search results listing specific tools to track celebrity status online. However, based on the concept of \"celebrity capital\" and influencer status acquisition discussed in the academic study on influencer celebrification, tracking celebrity status online involves monitoring social media platforms where influencers and celebrities build their fame through follower counts, engagement metrics, and collaborations within advertising ecosystems [11]. \n\nIn practice, the best tools to track celebrity status online typically include social media analytics platforms such as Social Blade, HypeAuditor, and Brandwatch, which provide data on follower growth, engagement rates, and audience demographics. These tools help quantify celebrity capital by analyzing social media presence and influence, which is central to modern celebrity status acquisition [11].\n\nSince the search results did not provide direct tool recommendations, this expert synthesis relies on the understanding that celebrity status today is largely measured and tracked through social media metrics and influencer marketing analytics platforms, reflecting the shift from traditional media to digital ecosystems [11].",

This sociocultural currency, known as **celebrity capital**, was traditionally acquired through institutional intermediaries like sports, television, music, and movies. Social media influencers (SMIs), however, acquire celebrity capital differently, bypassing such intermediaries. Based on interviews with 40 global advertising industry practitioners and influencers, this study conceptualizes **influencer celebrification**—the process by which SMIs acquire celebrity capital within an interconnected advertising ecosystem. This process involves three iterative practices: generative, collaborative, and evaluative. Advertising practitioners play key roles as talent scouts, creative concierges, and impact analysts. The study offers implications for advertising theory and practice.\n\nBeyond influencer marketing and celebrity capital acquisition, social media profoundly influences interpersonal communication patterns, language use, and societal communication dynamics. It reshapes communication styles, interaction norms, and community engagement, thereby altering how individuals and groups connect and communicate in contemporary society.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nCharli D’Amelio exemplifies a new generation of Internet fame, amassing over 40 million TikTok followers and nearly 12 million Instagram followers by age 15. Her fame translated into commercial success through contracts, branded products, and reality TV. This reflects the rise of influencer culture, where everyday people gain media attention and convert it into celebrity capital for endorsements.\n\n**Celebrity capital** is defined as accumulated media visibility through recurrent media representations, exchanged within celebrity endorsement for economic and social capital. Traditional celebrities gain this capital through institutional intermediaries, while SMIs gain popularity independently, often becoming famous for being famous online.\n\nThis study addresses the gap in understanding how SMIs acquire celebrity capital and the role of advertising practitioners in this process.\n\nImportantly, social media's impact extends beyond celebrity culture, influencing broader communication patterns.
