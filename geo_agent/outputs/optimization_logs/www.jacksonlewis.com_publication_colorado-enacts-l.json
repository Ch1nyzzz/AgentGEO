  "core_idea": "The document outlines Colorado’s Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA), which mandates employers to provide earned paid sick leave to employees, including specific provisions for accrual, usage, and carryover, as well as expanded leave rights during public health emergencies like COVID-19. It emphasizes employee eligibility, permissible reasons for leave, employer obligations for notice and recordkeeping, and protections against retaliation. The HFWA replaces prior emergency leave rules and establishes enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.",

  "initial_content": "Colorado has enacted the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (SB20-205) (HFWA) to require employers to provide employees with up to six days, or up to 48 hours, of earned paid sick leave.\nEmployers with at least 16 employees must begin providing earned paid sick leave on January 1, 2021. All employers, regardless of size, must begin providing earned paid sick leave effective January 1, 2022.\nEffective immediately, the HFWA requires that employers, regardless of size, comply with the federal Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which stays in effect until December 31, 2020. The Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act provides up to 80 hours of sick leave for COVID-19-related reasons. The HFWA does not require employers to comply with the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act of the FFCRA, which provides 12 weeks of pay to care for children whose school or place of care is closed, or childcare provider is unavailable, because of COVID-19-related reasons.\nColorado’s Division of Labor Standards and Statistics will have the authority to enforce the requirements of the HFWA. The Division will be providing rules regarding compensation and accrual of paid sick leave under the HFWA.\nEmployee Eligibility\nEmployees immediately begin to accrue paid sick leave upon hire and may use sick leave as soon as it is accrued.\nHow Employees Accrue Paid Sick Leave\nEach employee earns at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours the employee works, up to 48 hours of paid sick leave per year, unless the employer selects a higher limit.\nAn employer may satisfy the accrual requirements of the HFWA by providing the employee with an amount of paid sick leave that meets or exceeds the requirements of the HFWA at the beginning of the year.\nExempt employees who work less than a 40-hour workweek accrue paid sick leave based on the number of hours that comprise the employee’s normal workweek.\nReasons for Taking Accrued Paid Sick Leave\nEmployees may use accrued paid sick leave for the following reasons:\nThe employee:\n(i) Has a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition that prevents the employee from working;\n(ii) Needs to obtain a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or\n(iii) Needs to obtain preventive medical care.\nThe employee needs to care for a family member who:\n(i) Has a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition;\n(ii) Needs to obtain a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or\n(iii) Needs to obtain preventive medical care.\nThe employee or the employee’s family member has been the victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment and the use of leave is to:\n(i) Seek medical attention for the employee or the employee’s family member to recover from a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition caused by the domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment;\n(ii) Obtain services from a victim services organization;\n(iii) Obtain mental health or other counseling;\n(iv) Seek relocation due to the domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment; or\n(v) Seek legal services, including preparation for or participation in a civil or criminal proceeding relating to or resulting from the domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment;\nDue to a public health emergency, a public official has ordered closure of:\n(i) The employee’s place of business; or\n(ii) The school or place of care of the employee’s child and the employee needs to be absent from work to care for the employee’s child.\nTaking Paid Sick Leave\nEmployees must take paid sick leave in one-hour increments, unless the employer permits employees to take leave in smaller increments. Employers may loan paid sick leave to an employee who has not yet accrued it.\nEmployers may not require, as a condition of taking paid sick leave, that the employee search for and find a replacement worker to cover the employee’s paid sick leave.\nRequests for accrued paid sick leave must be made orally, in writing, electronically, or by any other means acceptable to the employer. When possible, the employee must include the expected duration of the absence. An employer may adopt a written policy that contains reasonable procedures for the employee to provide notice when the use of paid sick leave taken under the HFWA is foreseeable; however, an employer cannot deny paid sick leave to the employee based on noncompliance with such a policy. When the leave is foreseeable, employees should make a good faith effort to provide notice to the employer and make a reasonable effort to schedule paid sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt business operations.\nCarry Over of Accrued Paid Sick Leave\nEmployees may carry over up to 48 hours of unused paid sick leave to the following year; however, employers can limit the amount of leave an employee may take in any year to 48 hours.\nPaid Sick Leave at Separation\nThe HFWA does not create an obligation for employers to pay out unused, accrued paid sick leave at separation, regardless of the reason for separation.\nHowever, an individual may recover paid sick leave as a remedy for a retaliatory personnel action that prevented the individual from using paid sick leave.\nAdditionally, if an employer rehires a separated employee within six months of that employee’s separation, the employer must reinstate any unused, accrued paid sick leave the employee had during the employee’s previous employment.\nPaid Sick Leave and Public Health Emergencies (e.g., COVID-19)\nIn addition to the paid sick leave accrued as described above, employees are entitled to a one-time grant of leave in the event of a “public health emergency.”\nA public health emergency is defined as an act of bioterrorism, a pandemic influenza, or an epidemic caused by a novel and highly fatal infectious act, for which: (1) a disaster emergency is declared by the governor; or (2) an emergency is declared by a federal, state, or local public health agency; or (3) a highly infectious illness or agent with epidemic or pandemic potential for which a disaster emergency is declared by the governor.\nTo ensure employees may take paid sick leave for the reasons below, employers must supplement employees’ accrued paid sick leave as necessary (at least 80 hours for employees who work at least 40 hours a week; for employees who work fewer than 40 hours a week, the amount of time the employee is scheduled to work or the average of what the employee actually works in a 14-day period, whichever is greater):\nAn employee’s need to:\n(i) Self-isolate and care for oneself because the employee is diagnosed with a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(ii) Self-isolate and care for oneself because the employee is experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(iii) Seek or obtain medical diagnosis, care, or treatment if experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(iv) Seek preventive care concerning a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; or\n(v) Care for a family member who:\n(a) Is self-isolating after being diagnosed with a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(b) Is self-isolating due to experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(c) Needs medical diagnosis, care, or treatment if experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; or\n(d) Is seeking preventive care concerning a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\nOr if:\n(i) A local, state, or federal public official or health authority having jurisdiction over the location in which the employee’s place of employment is located or the employee’s employer determines that the employee’s presence on the job or in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the employee’s exposure to the communicable illness or because the employee is exhibiting symptoms of the communicable illness, regardless of whether the employee has been diagnosed with the communicable illness;\nOr to:\n(ii) Care for a family member after a local, state, or federal public official or health authority having jurisdiction over the location in which the family member’s place of employment is located or the family member’s employer determines that the family member’s presence on the job or in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the family member’s exposure to the communicable illness or because the family member is exhibiting symptoms of the communicable illness, regardless of whether the family member has been diagnosed with the communicable illness;\n(iii) Care for a child or other family member when the individual’s child care provider is unavailable due to a public health emergency, or if the child’s or family member’s school or place of care has been closed by a local, state, or federal public official or at the discretion of the school or place of care due to a public health emergency, including if a school or place of care is physically closed but providing instruction remotely;\nOr due to:\n(iv) An employee’s inability to work because the employee has a health condition that may increase susceptibility to or risk of a communicable illness that is the cause of the public health emergency.\nEmployers may count an employee’s unused, accrued paid time off toward this supplemental leave. Employers may not require documentation for taking this leave and employees may use this leave up until four weeks after the official termination or suspension of the public health emergency.\nRecordkeeping\nEmployers must retain records for each employee for a two-year period, documenting hours worked, paid sick leave accrued, and paid sick leave used.\nAnti-Retaliation\nThe HFWA prohibits retaliation against employees who take this leave, providing an avenue of relief if employees feel their employer has taken any adverse action against them.\nViolations of the HFWA includes compensating an employee until the employee is reinstated or, if reinstatement is not feasible, for a reasonable period.\nAn employer who willfully retaliates against an employee will be subject to a civil fine of up to $100 for each separate violation.\nAggrieved individuals also may file a civil action after submitting a complaint to the Division or after making a written demand for compensation or other relief to the employer. An employer has 14 days to respond after receiving a notice from the Division that a complaint has been filed with it or a written demand from the aggrieved person.\nNotice to Employees\nEmployers must notify its employees, in writing, that they are entitled to paid sick leave, in accordance with the rules that will be promulgated by the Division. Employers must immediately post the Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster and distribute to employees the Division’s Interpretive Notice & Formal Opinion #6A. Employers also must provide notices and posters in any language that is the first language spoken by at least five percent of its workforce.\nAdditional posters and notices will be made available to employers to comply with these notice requirements for 2021.\nColorado Health Emergency Leave with Pay (HELP) Rules Terminated\nColorado’s HELP Rules are no longer in effect. The HELP Rules were adopted and effective on March 11, 2020, and were to remain in effect for 30 days or the duration of the state of disaster emergency declared by the Governor up 120 days, whichever is greater. The Division terminated the requirements of the HELP Rules on July 14, the day before the HFWA went into effect.\nThe HELP Rules required employers to provide up to two weeks (up to a maximum of 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds of the employee’s regular rate of pay to employees with flu-like or respiratory illness symptoms who are being tested for COVID-19 or who are under instruction from a healthcare provider or authorized government official to quarantine or isolate due to a risk of having COVID-19.\n***\nJackson Lewis attorneys are available to assist employers in their compliance efforts. If you have questions about the HFWA, including the poster and employee notice requirements, revisions to language in employee handbooks, implementation strategies, or any other workplace issues, please contact the Jackson Lewis attorney with whom you regularly work.",

      "query": "new employment laws in colorado 2023 for small businesses",
      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "In 2023, Colorado enacted several significant employment law changes affecting small businesses, with many taking effect in 2023 and some extending into 2024. Key new laws and amendments include:\n\n1. **Protecting Opportunities and Workers’ Rights (POWR) Act (SB 23-172)** – Effective August 7, 2023, this act revises Colorado’s Anti-Discrimination Act by lowering the standard for unlawful harassment, expanding protected classes to include marital status, and imposing strict requirements on nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) related to discriminatory or unfair employment practices. Employers must now keep detailed records of discrimination complaints for at least five years. Violations of NDA provisions can result in penalties up to $5,000 per violation [2][4][5].\n\n2. **Job Application Fairness Act (JAFA) (SB 23-058)** – Effective July 1, 2024, JAFA prohibits employers from asking age-related questions (such as age, date of birth, or school attendance/graduation dates) on initial job applications. Employers may still verify age for bona fide occupational qualifications or legal requirements. The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) will enforce compliance with fines ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 for repeated violations [2][4][6].\n\n3. **Amendments to the Colorado Equal Pay for Equal Work Act (SB 23-105)** – Effective January 1, 2024, this law expands pay transparency and job posting requirements. Employers must post job opportunities internally and externally with salary ranges, benefits, and application deadlines. After hiring, employers must notify employees about the selected candidate and provide information on how to apply for similar jobs. The statute of limitations for wage discrimination claims is extended from three to six years [4][5][6].\n\n4. **Colorado Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) Act** – Payroll contributions began January 1, 2023, with employees eligible for up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave starting January 1, 2024. Employers must remit premiums and provide notice to employees about their rights. The program covers leave for bonding with a new child, serious health conditions, military exigencies, and domestic violence safety needs, with wage replacement capped at $1,100 per week [1][3][6][7].\n\n5. **Expanded Paid Sick Leave Uses under the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) (SB 23-017)** – Effective August 7, 2023, employees may use accrued paid sick leave for additional reasons such as grieving a family member’s death, attending funerals, handling related legal or financial matters, caring for family members affected by school or care closures due to inclement weather or emergencies, and evacuating residences under similar conditions. Employers should update sick leave policies accordingly [4][5][6][11].\n\n6. **Workers’ Compensation Amendments (HB 23-1076)** – Increased medical impairment benefits for mental impairments from 12 to 36 weeks, effective in 2023 [5].\n\n7. **Noncompete and Restrictive Covenant Law Changes** – Enhanced enforcement authority for the Attorney General and new limits on recovering employee education and training expenses, effective August 7, 2024 [6][9].\n\n8. **Minimum Wage Increase** – As of January 1, 2023, Colorado’s minimum wage rose to $13.65 per hour, with tipped employees at $10.63 per hour. Denver’s minimum wage is higher at $17.29 per hour [8].\n\n9. **Recordkeeping and Posting Requirements** – Employers must update labor law posters to reflect new minimum wage rates, paid leave rights, and anti-discrimination protections including marital status as a protected class. They must also maintain records of paid sick leave accrual and usage [10][11].\n\nFor small businesses (generally defined as those with 100 or fewer employees), these laws require careful attention to compliance, especially regarding nondiscrimination policies, wage transparency, leave administration, and application procedures. Employers should review and update employee handbooks, job postings, NDAs, and payroll systems to align with these changes. Consulting with employment law counsel is advisable to navigate the evolving legal landscape and mitigate risks such as wage theft claims, discrimination lawsuits, and penalties for noncompliance [1][4][5][9].\n\nIn summary, Colorado’s 2023 employment law changes emphasize enhanced employee protections in harassment, discrimination, wage transparency, and leave benefits, while imposing new employer obligations in recordkeeping, nondisclosure agreements, and fair hiring practices. Small businesses must proactively adapt policies and practices to comply and protect both their workforce and their operations [1][2][4][5][6][9].",

The HFWA does not require compliance with the FFCRA’s Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act.\n\n**Employee Eligibility and Accrual**  \n- Employees begin accruing paid sick leave immediately upon hire and may use it as soon as it is accrued.  \n- Employees earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.  \n- Employers may front-load the full amount of paid sick leave at the start of the year to satisfy accrual requirements.  \n- Exempt employees working less than 40 hours per week accrue leave based on their normal workweek hours.\n\n**Permissible Reasons for Using Paid Sick Leave**  \nEmployees may use accrued paid sick leave for:  \n- Their own mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care.  \n- Caring for a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care.  \n- Recovering from or addressing issues related to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment, including seeking medical attention, victim services, counseling, relocation, or legal services.  \n- Absences due to public health emergency orders closing the employee’s workplace or their child’s school or place of care.\n\n**Usage and Notice Requirements**  \n- Paid sick leave must be taken in one-hour increments unless the employer allows smaller increments.  \n- Employers may loan paid sick leave to employees who have not yet accrued it.  \n- Employers cannot require employees to find a replacement worker as a condition for taking leave.  \n- Leave requests can be made orally, in writing, electronically, or by any employer-accepted means.  \n- Employers may adopt reasonable written notice policies for foreseeable leave but cannot deny leave for noncompliance. Employees should provide good faith notice and attempt to schedule leave to minimize business disruption.\n\n**Carryover and Separation**  \n- Employees may carry over up to 48 hours of unused paid sick leave to the next year, but employers may cap annual usage at 48 hours.  \n- Employers are not required to pay out unused sick leave upon separation.  \n- If an employee is rehired within six months, the employer must reinstate any unused accrued paid sick leave from prior employment.  \n- Paid sick leave may be recovered as a remedy for retaliatory personnel actions that prevented its use.\n\n**Paid Sick Leave During Public Health Emergencies**  \n- Employees receive a one-time supplemental leave grant during a declared public health emergency (e.g., COVID-19), defined as a bioterrorism act, pandemic influenza, or epidemic with a declared disaster emergency.  \n- Supplemental leave must be at least 80 hours for full-time employees or the equivalent of scheduled/average hours for part-time employees.  \n- This leave covers:  \n  - Self-isolation or care due to diagnosis or symptoms of the communicable illness causing the emergency.  \n  - Seeking medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care related to the illness.  \n  - Caring for family members who are self-isolating, symptomatic, diagnosed, or seeking preventive care.  \n  - Situations where public officials determine the employee or family member’s presence would jeopardize others’ health.  \n  - Caring for children or family members when childcare or schools are closed or unavailable due to the emergency.  \n  - Employee’s inability to work due to a health condition increasing susceptibility to the illness.  \n- Employers may count unused accrued paid time off toward this supplemental leave.  \n- Documentation cannot be required for this leave, and it may be used up to four weeks after the public health emergency ends.\n\n**Recordkeeping and Enforcement**  \n- Employers must retain records for two years documenting hours worked, paid sick leave accrued, and used.  \n- Colorado’s Division of Labor Standards and Statistics enforces HFWA compliance and will issue rules on compensation and accrual.  \n- Violations may result in compensation to employees and civil fines up to $100 per willful retaliation violation.  \n- Employees may file complaints with the Division or pursue civil action after notifying the employer and allowing 14 days for response.\n\n**Anti-Retaliation Protections**  \n- The HFWA prohibits retaliation against employees for using paid sick leave and provides remedies for adverse actions.\n\n**Notice to Employees**  \n- Employers must notify employees in writing of their paid sick leave rights per Division rules.  \n- Employers must post the Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster and distribute the Division’s Interpretive Notice & Formal Opinion #6A.  \n- Notices and posters must be provided in any language spoken by at least 5% of the workforce.  \n- Additional materials will be available for 2021 compliance.\n\n**Termination of Colorado Health Emergency Leave with Pay (HELP) Rules**  \n- The HELP Rules, which required up to two weeks of paid sick leave at two-thirds pay for COVID-19-related reasons, were terminated on July 14, 2020, the day before the HFWA took effect.  \n- The HELP Rules required employers to provide up to two weeks (up to a maximum of 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds of the employee’s regular rate of pay to employees with flu-like or respiratory illness symptoms who are being tested for COVID-19 or who are under instruction from a healthcare provider or authorized government official to quarantine or isolate due to a risk of having COVID-19.\n\n**Employee Handbook Templates**  \nTo assist employers in complying with the HFWA and other workplace regulations, employee handbook templates can be a valuable resource. These templates provide a structured framework that includes essential policies such as paid sick leave provisions, notice requirements, and anti-retaliation protections. Using a well-crafted handbook template helps ensure consistency, legal compliance, and clear communication of employee rights and employer obligations. Employers can obtain these templates through various options, including purchasing from reputable legal or HR service providers, subscribing to online platforms offering customizable handbooks, or accessing free templates provided by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nWhen purchasing employee handbook templates specifically for Colorado businesses, employers should consider vendors that offer customization options to tailor policies to Colorado’s unique legal requirements, including the HFWA. Pricing for these templates varies widely, typically ranging from $100 to $500 for basic versions, with more comprehensive or subscription-based services costing more. Many providers offer add-ons such as regular legal updates, compliance alerts, and consultation services to help implement and maintain handbook policies effectively.\n\nTo select the right template, employers should evaluate whether the provider’s materials are regularly updated to reflect changes in Colorado labor laws, include clear guidance on HFWA compliance, and offer user-friendly customization tools. Implementation support, such as onboarding checklists or training materials, can further enhance the effectiveness of the handbook in communicating paid sick leave rights and employer responsibilities.\n\nIntegrating handbook templates into employee onboarding and ongoing communication strategies can enhance understanding and compliance with paid sick leave policies, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or violations. Employers are encouraged to review and update their handbooks regularly to ensure continued alignment with HFWA requirements and other applicable laws.\n\n***  \nJackson Lewis attorneys are available to assist employers in their compliance efforts.

      "final_answer": "In 2023, Colorado implemented several significant new legal requirements for employers hiring and managing new employees, with many changes effective as of August 7, 2023, and others starting January 1, 2024, or July 1, 2024. Employers must ensure compliance with these laws to avoid penalties and legal risks.\n\n**Key Legal Requirements for New Employees in Colorado (2023-2024):**\n\n1. **Protecting Opportunities and Workers’ Rights (POWR) Act (SB 23-172) – Effective August 7, 2023**  \n   - **Harassment Standard:** The definition of unlawful harassment was lowered from the federal “severe and pervasive” standard to prohibit any unwelcome conduct that is subjectively and objectively offensive based on protected class status, including marital status now added as a protected class. Employers must promptly investigate and remediate complaints to assert affirmative defenses in harassment claims.  \n   - **Nondisclosure Agreements (NDAs):** NDAs entered or renewed after August 7, 2023, are void unless they meet strict requirements, including mutual applicability, explicit carve-outs allowing employees to disclose discriminatory practices to certain parties or government agencies, and reasonable liquidated damages provisions. Violations can result in damages, penalties, and attorneys’ fees.  \n   - **Recordkeeping:** Employers must maintain a repository of all written or oral complaints of discriminatory or unfair employment practices for at least five years, including details such as dates, parties involved, and complaint substance.  \n   - **Disability Discrimination:** Employers may refuse to hire or take adverse action only if no reasonable accommodation can enable the individual to perform essential job functions, aligning with ADA standards.  \n   - These provisions apply to all private employers with at least one employee in Colorado [1][2][4].\n\n2. **Equal Pay for Equal Work Act Amendments (SB 23-105) – Effective January 1, 2024**  \n   - Employers must disclose salary ranges and general benefits in all job postings and internal job opportunity notices.  \n   - Employers must announce job opportunities to all Colorado employees on the same day before making hiring decisions, excluding “career development” and “career progression” which have specific definitions.  \n   - Within 30 days of hiring, employers must disclose to employees who will work with the new hire the selected candidate’s name, former and new job titles, and how employees can express interest in similar jobs.  \n   - The statute of limitations for wage discrimination claims based on sex is extended from three to six years.  \n   - Employers with fewer than 15 remote employees in Colorado and no physical presence in the state have reduced posting obligations until July 1, 2029 [2][4][8][10].\n\n3. **Job Application Fairness Act (JAFA) (SB 23-058) – Effective July 1, 2024**  \n   - Prohibits employers from asking applicants to disclose age, date of birth, or school attendance/graduation dates on initial job applications.  \n   - Employers may still verify age compliance with bona fide occupational qualifications or legal requirements.  \n   - Violations can lead to fines ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 per violation after an initial compliance order from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) [1][2][4][10].\n\n4. **Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) Program – Benefits Begin January 1, 2024**  \n   - Employers and employees contribute to a state-run paid family and medical leave program.  \n   - Eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for bonding with a new child, caring for family members, their own serious health condition, military family exigencies, or domestic violence-related needs. Pregnancy complications allow up to 16 weeks.  \n   - Employers must preserve job protections for employees who have worked at least 180 days.  \n   - Employers should update policies, designate contacts for FAMLI communications, and train HR on compliance [3][8][10].\n\n5. **Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) Amendments – Effective August 7, 2023**  \n   - Expands reasons employees may use accrued paid sick leave to include grieving a family member’s death, attending funerals, handling related legal/financial matters, caring for family members affected by school or care closures due to inclement weather or other unexpected events, and evacuating residences under similar conditions.  \n   - Employers must allow use of accrued sick leave for these reasons without retaliation or denial for business reasons.  \n   - Employees accrue at least one hour of paid sick leave per 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours per year [2][4][11].\n\n6. **Other Important Employment Law Updates**  \n   - Minimum wage increased to $13.65/hour statewide and $17.29/hour in Denver as of January 1, 2023.  \n   - Non-compete agreements are strictly limited, with penalties for violations, especially for employees earning below specified salary thresholds.  \n   - Employers must comply with Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws, including protections based on sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, and natural hairstyles (CROWN Act).  \n   - Employers must verify employment eligibility (I-9) and comply with Colorado’s ban-the-box law prohibiting criminal history questions on initial applications [5][7][9][10].\n\n**Practical Steps for Employers Hiring New Employees in Colorado:**  \n- Update job postings to include salary ranges, benefits, and application deadlines per Equal Pay laws.  \n- Remove age-related questions from initial applications by July 1, 2024, to comply with JAFA.  \n- Review and revise NDAs to meet POWR Act requirements or avoid using them.  \n- Establish and maintain a complaint repository for discrimination and harassment claims.  \n- Inform new hires about paid sick leave accrual and usage rights under HFWA.  \n- Prepare for FAMLI program administration and employee notifications starting in 2024.  \n- Train HR and management on new harassment standards and anti-discrimination protections.  \n- Ensure compliance with wage and hour laws, including minimum wage and overtime rules.  \n- Maintain proper employment verification and documentation, including I-9 and record retention.  \n- Review and update employee handbooks, offer letters, and employment contracts to reflect new legal requirements [5][6][11].\n\nIn summary, Colorado’s 2023-2024 legal landscape for new employees emphasizes enhanced protections against discrimination and harassment, pay transparency, expanded paid leave rights, and stricter controls on employment agreements. Employers should proactively update policies, training, and documentation to ensure full compliance and mitigate legal risks in their hiring and employment practices [1][2][3][4][5][6][8][10][11].",

      "final_answer": "The SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management) provides extensive resources and guidance on paid sick leave policies, recognizing the complexity and variability of laws across jurisdictions. Their policy page and related materials emphasize that paid sick leave has evolved from a benefit perk to a legal mandate in many areas, each with unique requirements that employers must carefully navigate to ensure compliance [1][7].\n\nKey points from SHRM’s resources include:\n\n1. **Complexity of Compliance**: Paid sick leave laws differ widely by state, city, and county, creating a patchwork of regulations that can be challenging for employers, especially those operating in multiple locations. Some states even restrict local jurisdictions from enacting their own paid sick leave laws to reduce complexity [7].\n\n2. **Accrual Methodologies**: Paid sick leave accrual can follow different models. Some laws use a \"bank cap\" system where employees accrue leave up to a maximum banked amount (e.g., 80 hours in California), after which accrual pauses until leave is used. Others impose an annual accrual limit that does not reset within the year, even if leave is used. Employers must understand which model applies in their jurisdiction to manage accruals correctly [7].\n\n3. **Interaction with Other Leave Laws**: Paid sick leave often intersects with other leave regulations such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), workers’ compensation, and state-specific leaves. Typically, paid sick leave covers short-term absences and can be used concurrently with or alongside other protected leaves, depending on the employer’s policies and legal requirements [7].\n\n4. **Policy Development Guidance**: SHRM offers tools such as sick leave policy templates to help employers craft compliant policies. These templates address accrual, usage, carryover, notice requirements, and anti-retaliation protections. For example, Colorado’s Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) mandates specific accrual rates, permissible uses, carryover rules, and public health emergency provisions, which can be incorporated into employee handbooks using SHRM’s or legal service providers’ templates [2][11].\n\n5. **Best Practices and Resources**: SHRM provides educational programs, seminars, webinars, and expert podcasts (e.g., “Paid Sick Leave Simplified”) to help HR professionals stay current on evolving laws and practical implementation strategies. These resources emphasize the importance of understanding local laws, communicating clearly with employees, and maintaining accurate records to avoid compliance issues [7][10].\n\n6. **Advocacy and Policy Position**: SHRM advocates for balanced, flexible workplace leave policies that support employee well-being and organizational success. Their stance encourages employers to design benefits that meet workforce needs while complying with federal, state, and local laws [3].\n\nIn summary, SHRM’s paid sick leave policy page and related resources provide HR professionals with comprehensive guidance on navigating the complex landscape of paid sick leave laws, including policy templates, compliance tips, and expert insights to help organizations implement effective and legally compliant paid sick leave programs.\n\nFor detailed policy templates and specific jurisdictional guidance, SHRM’s “Sick Leave Policy Template” and “6 Questions to Ask When Creating a Paid-Sick-Leave Policy” are valuable starting points [1][2]. Additionally, SHRM’s coverage of state-specific laws like Colorado’s HFWA offers practical examples of how to integrate legal requirements into workplace policies [11].\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n[1] SHRM - 6 Questions to Ask When Creating a Paid-Sick-Leave Policy, Nov 2023  \n[2] SHRM - Sick Leave Policy Template, Aug 2025  \n[3] SHRM - Workplace Flexibility & Leave Advocacy  \n[7] SHRM - Paid Sick Leave Simplified: Expert Tips for HR Pros Podcast, Jul 2025  \n[10] SHRM - 2025 Employee Benefits Survey: Leave Section  \n[11] Jackson Lewis via SHRM - Colorado Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) Summary and Handbook Template Guidance",

      "query": "what are the new worker benefits requirements in colorado 2023",
      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "In 2023, Colorado introduced several significant new worker benefits requirements affecting employers and employees, with many changes taking effect in 2023 and early 2024:\n\n1. **Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) Program**  \n   Starting January 1, 2024, Colorado began providing paid family and medical leave benefits under the FAMLI program, funded by employer and employee payroll contributions initiated in 2023. Eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of paid leave per year (up to 16 weeks for pregnancy or childbirth complications) for reasons including bonding with a new child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, their own serious health condition, military deployment arrangements, or addressing domestic violence and related issues. Job protection applies for employees who have worked at least 180 days with their employer. Employers must notify employees of their rights and handle leave requests according to the program, which is administered by the state, not the employer. Employers should update policies and designate contacts for FAMLI communications [2][4][6][9].\n\n2. **Expanded Paid Sick Leave Uses (SB 23-017)**  \n   Effective August 7, 2023, the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) was amended to allow employees to use accrued paid sick leave for additional reasons: grieving or attending funerals for family members, handling financial or legal matters after a family member’s death, caring for a family member whose school or place of care is unexpectedly closed (due to weather, power loss, etc.), and evacuating their residence for similar emergency reasons. Employers must update sick leave policies accordingly and cannot retaliate against employees using leave for these reasons [1][5][11].\n\n3. **Equal Pay for Equal Work Act Amendments (SB 23-105)**  \n   Starting January 1, 2024, Colorado strengthened pay transparency and job posting requirements. Employers must announce all “job opportunities” (defined as current or anticipated vacancies) internally and externally on the same day before making hiring decisions, including posting specific compensation ranges, benefits descriptions, and application deadlines. Employers must also disclose information about selected candidates to employees who will work with them within 30 days of hire, including the candidate’s name, former and new job titles, and how employees can express interest in similar jobs. For positions involving career progression, employers must provide eligible employees with detailed information about progression requirements and terms. Employers with no physical presence in Colorado and fewer than 15 remote employees in the state have limited posting obligations until 2029. The law also extends the statute of limitations for wage discrimination claims from three to six years and mandates the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment to actively investigate and mediate wage complaints [1][4][5][6][8].\n\n4. **Public Employees’ Workplace Protection Act (SB 23-111)**  \n   Effective August 7, 2023, this law grants public sector employees new rights to discuss workplace issues, join employee organizations, and participate politically off duty, with protections against employer retaliation. It applies to employees of counties, municipalities, school districts, public colleges, and other public entities [1].\n\n5. **Workers’ Compensation Amendments (HB 23-1076)**  \n   In 2023, amendments increased the maximum duration for medical impairment benefits related to mental impairment from 12 to 36 weeks, enhancing benefits for workers with mental health conditions resulting from workplace injuries [1][10].\n\n6. **Job Application Fairness Act (JAFA) (SB 23-058)**  \n   Beginning July 1, 2024, employers are prohibited from asking job applicants for age-related information on initial applications, including date of birth and education attendance or graduation dates, to reduce age discrimination risks. Employers may still verify age for bona fide occupational qualifications or legal requirements. The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment will enforce this law with fines for violations [1][5][8].\n\n7. **Other Notable Changes**  \n   - The Colorado Overtime and Minimum Pay Standards Order was updated effective January 1, 2024, including changes to minimum wage rates and overtime rules, especially for tipped employees [6][7].  \n   - The Protecting Opportunities and Workers’ Rights (POWR) Act, effective August 2023, expanded anti-discrimination protections, redefined harassment standards, voided certain nondisclosure agreements, and imposed new recordkeeping requirements on employers [1][5][6].  \n   - Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for pregnancy-related conditions (Pregnant Workers Fairness Act) and nursing mothers (PUMP Act) [7].  \n   - Employers must update workplace notices and posters to reflect these changes [7].\n\n**Summary:**  \nColorado’s 2023 worker benefits requirements emphasize expanded paid leave rights (both sick leave and family/medical leave), enhanced pay transparency and equal pay enforcement, stronger protections for public employees, and updated workers’ compensation benefits. Employers should review and update their policies, job postings, leave procedures, and compliance practices to align with these laws, many of which take full effect in 2024.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n[1] BHGR Law Client Alert, Aug 29, 2023  \n[2] The Colorado Sun, Dec 2022 - Paid Family Leave and other 2023 changes  \n[4] Gibson Dunn Client Alert, Dec 29, 2023 - 2024 Employment Law Changes  \n[5] Colorado Employment Law Summary, 2023 Legislative Session  \n[6] Employers Council Blog, Dec 2023 - 2023 Laws Summary  \n[7] Labor Law Center, Dec 2023 - COMPS and Poster Updates  \n[8] Colorado Dental Association, Winter 2025 Employment Law Update  \n[9] Center for American Progress, Paid Leave Facts in Colorado  \n[10] Babcock Tucker, Workers’ Compensation Benefits in Colorado  \n[11] Jackson Lewis, HFWA Paid Sick Leave Summary",

The HFWA does not require compliance with the FFCRA’s Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act.\n\n**Employee Eligibility and Accrual**  \n- Employees begin accruing paid sick leave immediately upon hire and may use it as soon as it is accrued.  \n- Employees earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.  \n- Employers may front-load the full amount of paid sick leave at the start of the year to satisfy accrual requirements.  \n- Exempt employees working less than 40 hours per week accrue leave based on their normal workweek hours.\n\n**Permissible Reasons for Using Paid Sick Leave**  \nEmployees may use accrued paid sick leave for:  \n- Their own mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care.  \n- Caring for a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care.  \n- Recovering from or addressing issues related to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment, including seeking medical attention, victim services, counseling, relocation, or legal services.  \n- Absences due to public health emergency orders closing the employee’s workplace or their child’s school or place of care.\n\n**Usage and Notice Requirements**  \n- Paid sick leave must be taken in one-hour increments unless the employer allows smaller increments.  \n- Employers may loan paid sick leave to employees who have not yet accrued it.  \n- Employers cannot require employees to find a replacement worker as a condition for taking leave.  \n- Leave requests can be made orally, in writing, electronically, or by any employer-accepted means.  \n- Employers may adopt reasonable written notice policies for foreseeable leave but cannot deny leave for noncompliance. Employees should provide good faith notice and attempt to schedule leave to minimize business disruption.\n\n**Carryover and Separation**  \n- Employees may carry over up to 48 hours of unused paid sick leave to the next year, but employers may cap annual usage at 48 hours.  \n- Employers are not required to pay out unused sick leave upon separation.  \n- If an employee is rehired within six months, the employer must reinstate any unused accrued paid sick leave from prior employment.  \n- Paid sick leave may be recovered as a remedy for retaliatory personnel actions that prevented its use.\n\n**Paid Sick Leave During Public Health Emergencies**  \n- Employees receive a one-time supplemental leave grant during a declared public health emergency (e.g., COVID-19), defined as a bioterrorism act, pandemic influenza, or epidemic with a declared disaster emergency.  \n- Supplemental leave must be at least 80 hours for full-time employees or the equivalent of scheduled/average hours for part-time employees.  \n- This leave covers:  \n  - Self-isolation or care due to diagnosis or symptoms of the communicable illness causing the emergency.  \n  - Seeking medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care related to the illness.  \n  - Caring for family members who are self-isolating, symptomatic, diagnosed, or seeking preventive care.  \n  - Situations where public officials determine the employee or family member’s presence would jeopardize others’ health.  \n  - Caring for children or family members when childcare or schools are closed or unavailable due to the emergency.  \n  - Employee’s inability to work due to a health condition increasing susceptibility to the illness.  \n- Employers may count unused accrued paid time off toward this supplemental leave.  \n- Documentation cannot be required for this leave, and it may be used up to four weeks after the public health emergency ends.\n\n**Recordkeeping and Enforcement**  \n- Employers must retain records for two years documenting hours worked, paid sick leave accrued, and used.  \n- Colorado’s Division of Labor Standards and Statistics enforces HFWA compliance and will issue rules on compensation and accrual.  \n- Violations may result in compensation to employees and civil fines up to $100 per willful retaliation violation.  \n- Employees may file complaints with the Division or pursue civil action after notifying the employer and allowing 14 days for response.\n\n**Anti-Retaliation Protections**  \n- The HFWA prohibits retaliation against employees for using paid sick leave and provides remedies for adverse actions.\n\n**Notice to Employees**  \n- Employers must notify employees in writing of their paid sick leave rights per Division rules.  \n- Employers must post the Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster and distribute the Division’s Interpretive Notice & Formal Opinion #6A.  \n- Notices and posters must be provided in any language spoken by at least 5% of the workforce.  \n- Additional materials will be available for 2021 compliance.\n\n**Termination of Colorado Health Emergency Leave with Pay (HELP) Rules**  \n- The HELP Rules, which required up to two weeks of paid sick leave at two-thirds pay for COVID-19-related reasons, were terminated on July 14, 2020, the day before the HFWA took effect.  \n- The HELP Rules required employers to provide up to two weeks (up to a maximum of 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds of the employee’s regular rate of pay to employees with flu-like or respiratory illness symptoms who are being tested for COVID-19 or who are under instruction from a healthcare provider or authorized government official to quarantine or isolate due to a risk of having COVID-19.\n\n**Employee Handbook Templates**  \nTo assist employers in complying with the HFWA and other workplace regulations, employee handbook templates can be a valuable resource. These templates provide a structured framework that includes essential policies such as paid sick leave provisions, notice requirements, and anti-retaliation protections. Using a well-crafted handbook template helps ensure consistency, legal compliance, and clear communication of employee rights and employer obligations. Employers can obtain these templates through various options, including purchasing from reputable legal or HR service providers, subscribing to online platforms offering customizable handbooks, or accessing free templates provided by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nWhen purchasing employee handbook templates specifically for Colorado businesses, employers should consider vendors that offer customization options to tailor policies to Colorado’s unique legal requirements, including the HFWA. Pricing for these templates varies widely, typically ranging from $100 to $500 for basic versions, with more comprehensive or subscription-based services costing more. Many providers offer add-ons such as regular legal updates, compliance alerts, and consultation services to help implement and maintain handbook policies effectively.\n\nTo select the right template, employers should evaluate whether the provider’s materials are regularly updated to reflect changes in Colorado labor laws, include clear guidance on HFWA compliance, and offer user-friendly customization tools. Implementation support, such as onboarding checklists or training materials, can further enhance the effectiveness of the handbook in communicating paid sick leave rights and employer responsibilities.\n\nIntegrating handbook templates into employee onboarding and ongoing communication strategies can enhance understanding and compliance with paid sick leave policies, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or violations. Employers are encouraged to review and update their handbooks regularly to ensure continued alignment with HFWA requirements and other applicable laws.\n\n***  \nJackson Lewis attorneys are available to assist employers in their compliance efforts.

      "query": "current state laws on mandatory sick leave for businesses",
      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "As of early 2026, there is no federal law mandating paid sick leave for private employers, but **at least 20 states plus Washington, D.C.** have enacted mandatory paid sick leave laws, each with varying requirements on accrual, usage, covered employers, and qualifying reasons for leave [1][7][10].\n\n### States with Mandatory Paid Sick Leave Laws\nKey states requiring paid sick leave include:\n\n- **Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.** [1][7][10].\n\n- **Alaska** implemented a paid sick leave law effective July 1, 2025, and **Nebraska** followed with a law effective October 1, 2025 [7].\n\n- **Illinois** requires paid leave usable for any reason, effective January 1, 2024, with local ordinances like Chicago’s also in effect [1][6][7].\n\n- Some states, like **Maine** and **Nevada**, have laws requiring paid leave for any reason, not just illness [1].\n\n### Key Features of State Paid Sick Leave Laws\n\n- **Accrual Rates:** Most states require employees to accrue at least 1 hour of paid sick leave per 30 to 40 hours worked. For example, Arizona and Colorado require 1 hour per 30 hours worked [1][7][11].\n\n- **Annual Caps:** Annual usage limits vary, typically ranging from 24 to 72 hours depending on the state and employer size. Arizona caps at 40 hours for large employers, while Colorado caps at 48 hours [1][7][11].\n\n- **Carryover:** Most states require unused sick leave to carry over to the next year, though employers may cap the amount of leave that can be used annually [1][7].\n\n- **Covered Employers and Employees:** Coverage generally applies to all private employers, with some exceptions for very small employers or specific industries. Employee eligibility often includes full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal workers [1][7].\n\n- **Qualifying Reasons:** Paid sick leave can be used for the employee’s own illness, preventive care, or to care for family members. Many states also include leave for reasons related to domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or public health emergencies [1][7][11].\n\n- **Family Member Definitions:** States vary in defining family members covered, often including biological, adopted, foster, step-relations, domestic partners, and sometimes individuals with a close association equivalent to family [1].\n\n### Recent and Upcoming Changes\n\n- **Connecticut** expanded its paid sick leave law effective January 1, 2026, lowering the employer size threshold and increasing accrual rates [1][7].\n\n- **Alaska** and **Nebraska** introduced new paid sick leave laws in 2025 [7].\n\n- **Missouri** briefly enacted a paid sick leave law in 2024 but repealed it in 2025; advocates are pursuing a constitutional amendment to reinstate it [7].\n\n- **California** expanded leave protections for victims of violence and broadened qualifying reasons for paid sick leave effective January 1, 2026 [9].\n\n- States continue to amend existing laws to broaden employee benefits and expand qualifying reasons for leave [6].\n\n### Compliance Considerations for Employers\n\n- Employers must track accruals accurately, maintain records (often for 2-4 years), and comply with state-specific posting and notice requirements [1][11].\n\n- Policies must reflect state-specific accrual rates, usage caps, carryover rules, and permissible reasons for leave.\n\n- Employers should avoid common compliance mistakes such as requiring doctor’s notes for short absences, applying a uniform policy across states without adjustments, or using sick leave as a disciplinary tool [7].\n\n- Multi-state employers face complex compliance challenges due to the patchwork of laws and local ordinances that may impose stricter requirements than state laws [1][7].\n\n### Example: Colorado’s Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA)\n\n- Requires all employers to provide paid sick leave starting January 1, 2022.\n\n- Employees accrue 1 hour per 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours per year.\n\n- Leave can be used for personal or family illness, domestic violence-related reasons, and public health emergencies.\n\n- Employers may front-load leave or allow accrual.\n\n- Unused leave carries over, but annual usage can be capped.\n\n- Provides anti-retaliation protections and requires employer notices and postings [11].\n\n---\n\n**In summary**, while there is no federal mandate, a growing number of states require private employers to provide paid sick leave with diverse rules on accrual, usage, and qualifying reasons. Employers must stay informed of state and local laws, especially as new laws take effect and existing laws expand in 2025-2026, to ensure compliance and avoid penalties [1][6][7][9][10][11].",

      "final_answer": "In 2023, worker benefits are evolving significantly to address changing employee expectations, economic pressures, and workforce dynamics. Key trends include:\n\n1. **Financial Wellness Programs**: Employers are increasingly integrating financial wellness into benefits, offering resources like budgeting advice, financial literacy education, flexible savings accounts, and student loan repayment assistance to reduce employee financial stress and improve engagement [1][3][4].\n\n2. **Personalization and Lifecycle Benefits**: Benefits are becoming more tailored to individual employee needs and life stages, allowing workers to choose perks that fit their family situation, age, and personal circumstances. This includes lifestyle spending accounts and support for diverse life events such as eldercare, fertility services, and bereavement [3][7].\n\n3. **Mental Health and Holistic Well-being**: Mental health support remains a top priority, with expanded access to counseling, substance use disorder treatment, on-site mental health providers, crisis response, and measurement-based care to improve outcomes. Employers recognize mental health benefits as critical for productivity and retention [5][6][7].\n\n4. **Flexible Work Arrangements**: Remote, hybrid, and flexible scheduling options continue to be highly valued, helping employees balance work and personal life, reduce stress, and increase job satisfaction. Employers also extend flexibility to non-remote roles through adaptable schedules and workplace environment improvements [1][3][7].\n\n5. **Voluntary and Unique Benefits**: To attract and retain talent, companies offer voluntary benefits such as critical illness insurance, pet insurance, identity theft protection, and family-friendly perks like paid parental leave, adoption support, and surrogacy benefits. Unique benefits aligned with company values help differentiate employers in a competitive market [3][6][7].\n\n6. **Consolidation and Simplification of Benefits Tools**: Employers are streamlining benefits administration by consolidating platforms and tools to improve employee utilization and reduce costs, especially important amid rising healthcare expenses [3].\n\n7. **Addressing Cumulative Stress and Burnout**: Recognizing that stress accumulates from both work and personal life, employers are focusing on holistic well-being strategies, including manager training for better communication, workload management, and fostering a supportive culture to prevent burnout and turnover [4].\n\n8. **Compliance with Paid Sick Leave Laws**: In regions like Colorado, employers are adapting to laws such as the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA), which mandates earned paid sick leave with specific accrual, usage, and anti-retaliation provisions, reflecting a broader trend toward legislated employee protections [11].\n\nOverall, 2023 benefits trends emphasize a holistic, flexible, and personalized approach that supports employees’ financial, mental, and physical well-being while helping employers manage costs and improve retention in a competitive labor market [1][3][4][5][6][7][11].",

These templates provide a structured framework that includes essential policies such as paid sick leave provisions, notice requirements, and anti-retaliation protections. Using a well-crafted handbook template helps ensure consistency, legal compliance, and clear communication of employee rights and employer obligations. Employers can obtain these templates through various options, including purchasing from reputable legal or HR service providers, subscribing to online platforms offering customizable handbooks, or accessing free templates provided by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nWhen purchasing employee handbook templates specifically for Colorado businesses, employers should consider vendors that offer customization options to tailor policies to Colorado’s unique legal requirements, including the HFWA. Pricing for these templates varies widely, typically ranging from $100 to $500 for basic versions, with more comprehensive or subscription-based services costing more. Many providers offer add-ons such as regular legal updates, compliance alerts, and consultation services to help implement and maintain handbook policies effectively.\n\nTo select the right template, employers should evaluate whether the provider’s materials are regularly updated to reflect changes in Colorado labor laws, include clear guidance on HFWA compliance, and offer user-friendly customization tools. Implementation support, such as onboarding checklists or training materials, can further enhance the effectiveness of the handbook in communicating paid sick leave rights and employer responsibilities.\n\nIntegrating handbook templates into employee onboarding and ongoing communication strategies can enhance understanding and compliance with paid sick leave policies, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or violations. Employers are encouraged to review and update their handbooks regularly to ensure continued alignment with HFWA requirements and other applicable laws.\n\n**Current Employee Benefits Trends and Strategic Considerations**  \nIn addition to compliance with the HFWA, Colorado employers are increasingly adapting their benefits offerings to meet evolving workforce needs and economic conditions in 2023. Key trends include:  \n- **Expansion of Mental Health Benefits:** Employers are broadening access to mental health services, including counseling, teletherapy, and wellness programs, recognizing the growing importance of mental well-being in employee productivity and retention.  \n- **Financial Wellness Programs:** Many employers are introducing or enhancing financial education, debt management, and retirement planning resources to support employees’ overall financial health.  \n- **Flexible Work Arrangements:** Remote work options, flexible scheduling, and hybrid models continue to be popular, helping employers attract and retain talent while accommodating diverse employee needs.  \n- **Family-Friendly Benefits:** Expanded parental leave, childcare support, and eldercare resources are increasingly offered to support employees balancing work and family responsibilities.  \n- **Voluntary Benefits:** Supplemental benefits such as pet insurance, identity theft protection, and legal assistance are gaining traction as cost-effective ways to enhance total rewards packages.  \n- **Talent Attraction and Retention Strategies:** Employers are leveraging comprehensive benefits packages, including paid sick leave compliance, to differentiate themselves in a competitive labor market, improve employee engagement, and reduce turnover.  \n\nThese trends reflect a broader shift toward holistic employee well-being and flexibility, influenced by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and changing workforce expectations. Employers who integrate HFWA compliance with these evolving benefits strategies position themselves to better meet employee needs and maintain a competitive advantage.\n\n***  \nJackson Lewis attorneys are available to assist employers in their compliance efforts.

      "query": "what are the new sick leave requirements for businesses in colorado?",
      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "Colorado’s new sick leave requirements are governed by the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA), which mandates that all employers in the state provide paid sick leave to their employees, regardless of business size, effective January 1, 2022 [1][2][3][6][8][11].\n\nKey provisions include:\n\n- **Accrual and Amount**: Employees accrue paid sick leave at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours (6 days) per year. Employers may frontload the full 48 hours at the start of the year but must still allow unused leave to carry over to the next year, capped at 48 hours of usage annually [1][2][6][7][8][11].\n\n- **Eligibility**: Paid sick leave accrual begins immediately upon hire. Most employees are covered, including full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal workers. Independent contractors and certain government employees are exempt. Employees become protected from retaliation after 180 days of continuous employment [2][3][6][7][8][11].\n\n- **Permissible Uses**: Employees may use accrued sick leave for their own or a family member’s mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care. Family members include children (biological, adopted, foster, or stepchildren), spouses or domestic partners, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, and siblings. Leave can also be used for absences related to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment, including seeking medical attention, counseling, relocation, or legal services. Additionally, leave covers absences due to public health emergency orders closing the employee’s workplace or their child’s school or place of care, as well as new qualifying events such as grieving a family member’s death, caring for family during school closures due to inclement weather or utility loss, and evacuations due to emergencies [1][2][3][6][7][8][11].\n\n- **Public Health Emergency Leave**: During declared public health emergencies (e.g., COVID-19), employees are entitled to supplemental paid sick leave of up to 80 hours (pro-rated for part-time workers). This leave covers illness, testing, vaccination, care for family members, and related absences. It remains available for up to four weeks after the emergency ends [1][2][6][8][11].\n\n- **Usage and Notice**: Leave must be taken in one-hour increments unless the employer allows smaller increments. Employers may require reasonable documentation only for absences of four or more consecutive workdays but cannot require disclosure of specific medical or domestic violence details. Employees must provide notice as soon as practicable for emergencies and follow reasonable notice policies for foreseeable leave, but employers cannot deny leave for failure to comply with notice policies if the employee acted in good faith [2][3][6][7][11].\n\n- **Job Protection and Anti-Retaliation**: Employees are protected from retaliation, discipline, demotion, or termination for using paid sick leave or asserting their rights under the HFWA after 180 days of employment. Employers must reinstate accrued leave if an employee is rehired within six months [2][3][6][7][11].\n\n- **Recordkeeping and Enforcement**: Employers must maintain records of hours worked, sick leave accrued, and used for at least two years. The Colorado Division of Labor Standards and Statistics enforces compliance, with penalties for violations including back pay, fines, and civil penalties up to $100 per willful retaliation violation. Employees may file complaints or pursue civil action after notifying the employer [2][4][8][11].\n\n- **Notice Requirements**: Employers must provide written notice of paid sick leave rights to employees at hire and post the official Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster in visible locations or electronically for remote workers. Notices must be in English and any language spoken by at least 5% of the workforce [3][6][7][11].\n\nIn summary, Colorado’s HFWA establishes a comprehensive paid sick leave framework requiring all employers to provide accrued paid sick leave with broad usage rights, job protections, and supplemental leave during public health emergencies. Employers must carefully track accruals, usage, and maintain compliance with notice and recordkeeping obligations to avoid penalties [1][2][3][6][7][8][11].",

      "final_answer": "For a comprehensive understanding of employee benefits in Colorado, several high-quality resources are available that cover legal requirements, benefit planning, and practical employer guidance:\n\n1. **Colorado Employment Laws and Employee Benefits Overview**  \n   The PeopleKeep guide offers an in-depth review of Colorado-specific employment laws and required employee benefits. It covers key topics such as at-will employment, the Colorado Chance to Compete Act (ban the box), Equal Pay for Equal Work Act, anti-discrimination laws, wage and hour rules, meal and rest breaks, nursing mother accommodations, and COBRA continuation coverage. This resource is essential for employers to ensure compliance with both federal and Colorado state laws and understand mandatory and optional benefits in the state [1].\n\n2. **Benefits Education and Communication for Employers**  \n   Conexus Insurance Partners emphasizes the importance of employee education on benefits to maximize their value. They provide tailored communication strategies and enrollment support to help Colorado employers design benefit plans that employees understand and appreciate, which is critical for recruitment and retention [2].\n\n3. **Benefits Planning for Individuals with Disabilities**  \n   The Colorado APSE Benefits Planning Guide is a specialized resource for individuals with disabilities and their families. It explains how work income affects public benefits like SSI, SSDI, Medicaid waivers, and other assistance programs. Certified Benefits Planners help beneficiaries make informed decisions about employment and benefits retention, offering personalized reports and ongoing support. This guide is particularly useful for employers and employees navigating benefits related to disability and public assistance [3].\n\n4. **State of Colorado Employee Benefits Guide**  \n   The official State of Colorado Employee Benefits Guide (FY 2024-25 and FY 2025-26 editions) provides detailed information on the benefits package available to state employees, including medical, dental, vision, life insurance, disability, wellness programs, and enrollment procedures. It also outlines eligibility, dependent coverage, open enrollment timelines, and recent changes such as new health savings account administrators and coverage updates. This guide is a model for understanding comprehensive public sector benefits in Colorado [5][6][7].\n\n5. **Industry and Market Benchmarking Tools**  \n   MployerAdvisor.com offers tools and reports that allow employers to compare their benefits packages against other companies in Colorado by industry, size, and region. They provide insights on financial benefits like 401(k) plans, bonuses, wellness programs, flexible work arrangements, and other perks that enhance employee quality of life. This resource helps employers design competitive and attractive benefits packages [4][9].\n\n6. **Colorado Employment Law Summaries**  \n   Brightmine and Deel provide detailed summaries of Colorado employment laws affecting employee benefits, including wage and hour rules, paid sick leave (Healthy Families and Workplaces Act), anti-discrimination protections, family and medical leave, and workplace accommodations. These resources are valuable for understanding the legal context in which employee benefits operate in Colorado [8][10][11].\n\n7. **Paid Sick Leave Compliance and Management**  \n   The Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) mandates earned paid sick leave for Colorado employees with specific accrual, usage, and carryover rules. Employers must comply with notification, recordkeeping, and anti-retaliation provisions. Resources also exist for employee handbook templates and compliance technology to manage HFWA obligations effectively [11].\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo best understand employee benefits in Colorado, employers and HR professionals should consult the PeopleKeep guide for legal compliance, use Conexus Insurance for benefits education strategies, leverage the Colorado APSE guide for disability-related benefits planning, and review the State of Colorado Employee Benefits Guide for public sector standards. Additionally, benchmarking tools from MployerAdvisor.com and legal summaries from Brightmine and Deel provide valuable context on market practices and regulatory requirements. For paid sick leave compliance, the HFWA resources and related compliance tools are essential. Together, these resources offer a rigorous, comprehensive foundation for understanding and managing employee benefits in Colorado.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n[1] PeopleKeep Colorado Employee Benefits and HR Rules Guide  \n[2] Conexus Insurance Partners – Employee Benefits Education in Colorado  \n[3] Colorado APSE Benefits Planning Guide (October 2024)  \n[4] MployerAdvisor.com – Colorado Employee Benefits and Financial Perks  \n[5][6][7] State of Colorado Employee Benefits Guide FY 2024-25 and FY 2025-26  \n[8] Brightmine Colorado Employment Law Overview  \n[9] MployerAdvisor.com – Employee Medical Benefits Summary Colorado  \n[10] Deel – Colorado Employment and Labor Laws Overview (June 2025)  \n[11] Colorado Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) Paid Sick Leave Compliance",

These templates provide a structured framework that includes essential policies such as paid sick leave provisions, notice requirements, and anti-retaliation protections. Using a well-crafted handbook template helps ensure consistency, legal compliance, and clear communication of employee rights and employer obligations. Employers can obtain these templates through various options, including purchasing from reputable legal or HR service providers, subscribing to online platforms offering customizable handbooks, or accessing free templates provided by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nWhen purchasing employee handbook templates specifically for Colorado businesses, employers should consider vendors that offer customization options to tailor policies to Colorado’s unique legal requirements, including the HFWA. Pricing for these templates varies widely, typically ranging from $100 to $500 for basic versions, with more comprehensive or subscription-based services costing more. Many providers offer add-ons such as regular legal updates, compliance alerts, and consultation services to help implement and maintain handbook policies effectively.\n\nTo select the right template, employers should evaluate whether the provider’s materials are regularly updated to reflect changes in Colorado labor laws, include clear guidance on HFWA compliance, and offer user-friendly customization tools. Implementation support, such as onboarding checklists or training materials, can further enhance the effectiveness of the handbook in communicating paid sick leave rights and employer responsibilities.\n\nIntegrating handbook templates into employee onboarding and ongoing communication strategies can enhance understanding and compliance with paid sick leave policies, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or violations. Employers are encouraged to review and update their handbooks regularly to ensure continued alignment with HFWA requirements and other applicable laws.\n\n**Compliance Technology and Legal Tools for HFWA Management**  \nTo further support compliance with the HFWA, many Colorado employers are turning to specialized legal compliance tools and software platforms designed to simplify the management of paid sick leave obligations. These technology solutions automate tracking of accrual, usage, carryover, and notice requirements, reducing administrative burdens and minimizing errors.\n\nPopular platforms often include features such as:  \n- Automated accrual calculations based on hours worked and employee classifications.  \n- Real-time leave balance tracking accessible to both employers and employees.  \n- Integrated notice and documentation management to ensure timely communication and compliance with HFWA posting and notification rules.  \n- Reporting tools that facilitate recordkeeping and audit readiness in line with Colorado’s two-year retention requirements.  \n- Alerts and updates reflecting changes in state labor laws and HFWA regulations to keep employers informed and compliant.  \n- Integration capabilities with payroll, timekeeping, and human resources information systems (HRIS) for seamless data synchronization.\n\nExamples of reputable compliance tools used by Colorado employers include platforms like BambooHR, Gusto, Zenefits, and Deputy, which offer modules or features tailored to paid sick leave management. Additionally, some legal service providers offer compliance software bundled with advisory support to help interpret and implement HFWA requirements effectively.\n\nEmployers adopting these tools benefit from improved accuracy in leave tracking, reduced risk of noncompliance penalties, streamlined employee communication, and enhanced ability to respond promptly to regulatory changes. When selecting a compliance platform, employers should consider factors such as ease of use, scalability, integration with existing systems, customer support, and the provider’s expertise in Colorado labor law.\n\n**Current Employee Benefits Trends and Strategic Considerations**  \nIn addition to compliance with the HFWA, Colorado employers are increasingly adapting their benefits offerings to meet evolving workforce needs and economic conditions in 2023. Key trends include:  \n- **Expansion of Mental Health Benefits:** Employers are broadening access to mental health services, including counseling, teletherapy, and wellness programs, recognizing the growing importance of mental well-being in employee productivity and retention.  \n- **Financial Wellness Programs:** Many employers are introducing or enhancing financial education, debt management, and retirement planning resources to support employees’ overall financial health.  \n- **Flexible Work Arrangements:** Remote work options, flexible scheduling, and hybrid models continue to be popular, helping employers attract and retain talent while accommodating diverse employee needs.  \n- **Family-Friendly Benefits:** Expanded parental leave, childcare support, and eldercare resources are increasingly offered to support employees balancing work and family responsibilities.  \n- **Voluntary Benefits:** Supplemental benefits such as pet insurance, identity theft protection, and legal assistance are gaining traction as cost-effective ways to enhance total rewards packages.  \n- **Talent Attraction and Retention Strategies:** Employers are leveraging comprehensive benefits packages, including paid sick leave compliance, to differentiate themselves in a competitive labor market, improve employee engagement, and reduce turnover.  \n\nThese trends reflect a broader shift toward holistic employee well-being and flexibility, influenced by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and changing workforce expectations.

Many vendors offer subscription services that provide automatic updates and replacement posters to ensure ongoing compliance with changing laws.\n\nMaintaining current labor law posters is critical to avoid penalties and demonstrate compliance with workplace posting requirements.

      "query": "what are the mandatory sick leave laws in colorado for small businesses",
      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "In Colorado, the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) mandates that all employers, regardless of size, provide paid sick leave to their employees starting January 1, 2022. Initially, from January 1, 2021, only employers with 16 or more employees were required to comply, but since 2022, this applies to all employers with one or more employees in Colorado [1][2][3][6][11].\n\n**Key provisions for small businesses include:**\n\n- **Accrual:** Employees begin accruing paid sick leave immediately upon hire, earning at least 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours per year. Employers may frontload the full 48 hours at the start of the year if they choose [1][3][6][11].\n\n- **Usage:** Employees can use accrued sick leave as it is earned, in increments of at least one hour (unless the employer allows smaller increments). Leave can be used for a broad range of reasons including the employee’s or a family member’s physical or mental illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care. It also covers absences related to domestic abuse, sexual assault, harassment, workplace or school closures during public health emergencies, bereavement, and certain emergency situations like power or utility loss [1][2][3][6][9][11].\n\n- **Family Member Definition:** Family members include those related by blood, marriage, civil union, or adoption; children or persons for whom the employee stands in loco parentis; and persons for whom the employee provides health- or safety-related care [1][2][9][11].\n\n- **Carryover and Caps:** Employees may carry over up to 48 hours of unused paid sick leave to the next year, but employers may cap annual usage at 48 hours. Unused leave is not paid out upon separation, but if an employee is rehired within six months, the employer must reinstate any unused accrued leave [1][3][6][11].\n\n- **Notice and Documentation:** Employers may require reasonable documentation for absences of four or more consecutive days but cannot require disclosure of specific health or safety details. Employees must provide notice in good faith for foreseeable leave but cannot be denied leave for failure to comply with notice policies [1][2][6][11].\n\n- **Job Protection and Anti-Retaliation:** Employees who have worked for 180 days have job protection when taking paid sick leave. The law prohibits retaliation against employees for using sick leave, and employers must reinstate accrued leave if employees are rehired within six months [3][6][11].\n\n- **Public Health Emergency Leave:** In addition to accrued sick leave, during declared public health emergencies (such as COVID-19), employers must provide supplemental paid sick leave (up to 80 hours for full-time employees) for COVID-related reasons. This leave is available immediately and does not require accrual. Documentation cannot be required for this emergency leave [2][3][6][11].\n\n- **Recordkeeping:** Employers must keep records of hours worked, sick leave accrued, and leave used for at least two years to comply with state law and for enforcement purposes [11].\n\n- **Applicability:** The law covers nearly all employees, including part-time, temporary, and seasonal workers, but excludes independent contractors. Employers with collective bargaining agreements may be exempt if the agreement provides equivalent or more generous paid sick leave [3][6][11].\n\nFor small businesses, this means that starting in 2022, even those with fewer than 16 employees must comply fully with the HFWA’s paid sick leave requirements, including accrual, usage, carryover, and public health emergency leave provisions. Employers can satisfy the law by providing a paid time off (PTO) policy that meets or exceeds these requirements [1][3][6][11].\n\nEmployers are encouraged to post required notices, maintain proper records, and implement clear policies to ensure compliance and avoid penalties. Legal counsel or compliance tools can assist in navigating these obligations effectively [1][4][6][11].\n\n**Summary:**  \nColorado’s mandatory paid sick leave law requires all employers, including small businesses, to provide paid sick leave accruing at 1 hour per 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours annually, usable for a wide range of health and safety reasons, with job protections and anti-retaliation safeguards. Supplemental leave during public health emergencies is also mandated. Employers must maintain records and provide notices to employees to remain compliant [1][2][3][6][9][11].\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n[1] Galvanize Law Group, Healthy Families and Workplace Act overview  \n[2] Good Business Colorado, Colorado Paid Sick Leave Law summary  \n[3] Snell & Wilmer LLP, Colorado Healthy Families and Workplace Act details  \n[6] Colorado Lawyer Magazine, Paid Sick Leave Requirements under HFWA  \n[9] Patriot Software, Colorado Paid Sick Leave FAQs  \n[11] Comprehensive HFWA summary including accrual, usage, and enforcement",
      "modified_content": "Colorado has enacted the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (SB20-205) (HFWA), which requires employers to provide earned paid sick leave to employees with specific provisions for accrual, usage, carryover, and expanded leave rights during public health emergencies.\n\n**Effective Dates and Employer Coverage**  \n- Employers with 16 or more employees must provide earned paid sick leave starting January 1, 2021.  \n- All employers, regardless of size, must comply starting January 1, 2022.  \n- Until December 31, 2020, employers must comply with the federal Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which provides up to 80 hours of COVID-19-related sick leave.

These templates provide a structured framework that includes essential policies such as paid sick leave provisions, notice requirements, and anti-retaliation protections. Using a well-crafted handbook template helps ensure consistency, legal compliance, and clear communication of employee rights and employer obligations. Employers can obtain these templates through various options, including purchasing from reputable legal or HR service providers, subscribing to online platforms offering customizable handbooks, or accessing free templates provided by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nWhen purchasing employee handbook templates specifically for Colorado businesses, employers should consider vendors that offer customization options to tailor policies to Colorado’s unique legal requirements, including the HFWA. Pricing for these templates varies widely, typically ranging from $100 to $500 for basic versions, with more comprehensive or subscription-based services costing more. Many providers offer add-ons such as regular legal updates, compliance alerts, and consultation services to help implement and maintain handbook policies effectively.\n\nTo select the right template, employers should evaluate whether the provider’s materials are regularly updated to reflect changes in Colorado labor laws, include clear guidance on HFWA compliance, and offer user-friendly customization tools. Implementation support, such as onboarding checklists or training materials, can further enhance the effectiveness of the handbook in communicating paid sick leave rights and employer responsibilities.\n\nIntegrating handbook templates into employee onboarding and ongoing communication strategies can enhance understanding and compliance with paid sick leave policies, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or violations. Employers are encouraged to review and update their handbooks regularly to ensure continued alignment with HFWA requirements and other applicable laws.\n\n**Compliance Technology and Legal Tools for HFWA Management**  \nTo further support compliance with the HFWA, many Colorado employers are turning to specialized legal compliance tools and software platforms designed to simplify the management of paid sick leave obligations. These technology solutions automate tracking of accrual, usage, carryover, and notice requirements, reducing administrative burdens and minimizing errors.\n\nPopular platforms often include features such as:  \n- Automated accrual calculations based on hours worked and employee classifications.  \n- Real-time leave balance tracking accessible to both employers and employees.  \n- Integrated notice and documentation management to ensure timely communication and compliance with HFWA posting and notification rules.  \n- Reporting tools that facilitate recordkeeping and audit readiness in line with Colorado’s two-year retention requirements.  \n- Alerts and updates reflecting changes in state labor laws and HFWA regulations to keep employers informed and compliant.  \n- Integration capabilities with payroll, timekeeping, and human resources information systems (HRIS) for seamless data synchronization.\n\nExamples of reputable compliance tools used by Colorado employers include platforms like BambooHR, Gusto, Zenefits, and Deputy, which offer modules or features tailored to paid sick leave management. Additionally, some legal service providers offer compliance software bundled with advisory support to help interpret and implement HFWA requirements effectively.\n\nEmployers adopting these tools benefit from improved accuracy in leave tracking, reduced risk of noncompliance penalties, streamlined employee communication, and enhanced ability to respond promptly to regulatory changes. When selecting a compliance platform, employers should consider factors such as ease of use, scalability, integration with existing systems, customer support, and the provider’s expertise in Colorado labor law.\n\n**Current Employee Benefits Trends and Strategic Considerations**  \nIn addition to compliance with the HFWA, Colorado employers are increasingly adapting their benefits offerings to meet evolving workforce needs and economic conditions in 2023. Key trends include:  \n- **Expansion of Mental Health Benefits:** Employers are broadening access to mental health services, including counseling, teletherapy, and wellness programs, recognizing the growing importance of mental well-being in employee productivity and retention.  \n- **Financial Wellness Programs:** Many employers are introducing or enhancing financial education, debt management, and retirement planning resources to support employees’ overall financial health.  \n- **Flexible Work Arrangements:** Remote work options, flexible scheduling, and hybrid models continue to be popular, helping employers attract and retain talent while accommodating diverse employee needs.  \n- **Family-Friendly Benefits:** Expanded parental leave, childcare support, and eldercare resources are increasingly offered to support employees balancing work and family responsibilities.  \n- **Voluntary Benefits:** Supplemental benefits such as pet insurance, identity theft protection, and legal assistance are gaining traction as cost-effective ways to enhance total rewards packages.  \n- **Talent Attraction and Retention Strategies:** Employers are leveraging comprehensive benefits packages, including paid sick leave compliance, to differentiate themselves in a competitive labor market, improve employee engagement, and reduce turnover.  \n\nThese trends reflect a broader shift toward holistic employee well-being and flexibility, influenced by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and changing workforce expectations. Employers who integrate HFWA compliance with these evolving benefits strategies position themselves to better meet employee needs and maintain a competitive advantage.\n\n**Colorado Secretary of State Business Resources**  \nThe Colorado Secretary of State plays a vital role in business formation, maintenance, and legislative oversight, providing essential resources that complement employer compliance efforts under the HFWA. Employers and business owners can access official business legislation pages, registration and filing services, and other regulatory information through the Secretary of State’s website.\n\nKey services include:  \n- **Business Registration and Filings:** Online portals for registering new businesses, filing annual and periodic reports, and maintaining good standing with the state. This includes trade name registration and other filings necessary for business operations.  \n- **Access to Business Legislation:** Comprehensive and up-to-date information on Colorado business laws, statutes, and administrative rules relevant to employers, available at [https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/businessHome.html](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/businessHome.html).  \n- **Compliance and Reporting Tools:** Resources to assist with ongoing business compliance, including licensing, regulatory filings, and reminders for required submissions.  \n- **Contact and Support:** Direct links and contact information for the Secretary of State’s office to assist with business-related inquiries and support navigating state requirements.\n\n**Colorado Labor Law Posters**  \nIn addition to these resources, employers must comply with legal posting requirements by displaying up-to-date labor law posters in the workplace. These posters inform employees of their rights under federal and state laws, including the HFWA, minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, OSHA safety regulations, and unemployment insurance. Colorado employers are required to post both state and federal labor law posters in a conspicuous location accessible to all employees.\n\nPosters typically include:  \n- **Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster:** Required under the HFWA to notify employees of their paid sick leave rights.  \n- **Federal Posters:** Such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) notices.  \n- **OSHA Posters:** Informing employees of workplace safety and health protections.\n\nEmployers can purchase official labor law posters from authorized vendors, including government agencies, professional HR service providers, and online retailers. Pricing generally ranges from $20 to $60 per poster set, with options for laminated or digital versions. Many vendors offer subscription services that provide automatic updates and replacement posters to ensure ongoing compliance with changing laws.\n\nMaintaining current labor law posters is critical to avoid penalties and demonstrate compliance with workplace posting requirements. Employers should review and update posters annually or whenever new laws or regulations take effect. Utilizing vendor update services or compliance platforms can simplify this process and reduce administrative burden.\n\nExamples of reputable poster providers include the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, the U.S. Department of Labor’s website, and private companies such as PosterCompliance, LaborLawCenter, and HRdirect. Employers should verify that posters are specific to Colorado and include all required notices relevant to their workforce.\n\nEmployers are encouraged to integrate labor law poster compliance into their overall HFWA and workplace communication strategies to ensure employees are fully informed of their rights and protections.\n\nEmployers and business owners are encouraged to utilize these official resources to ensure their business operations align with state requirements and to stay informed about legislative changes that may impact workplace policies, including those related to the HFWA. Regular consultation of these resources can help maintain compliance with evolving business laws and support effective management of employer obligations.\n\nFor more information, visit the Colorado Secretary of State’s official website at [https://www.sos.state.co.us](https://www.sos.state.co.us).\n\n***  \nJackson Lewis attorneys are available to assist employers in their compliance efforts.

These templates provide a structured framework that includes essential policies such as paid sick leave provisions, notice requirements, and anti-retaliation protections. Using a well-crafted handbook template helps ensure consistency, legal compliance, and clear communication of employee rights and employer obligations. Employers can obtain these templates through various options, including purchasing from reputable legal or HR service providers, subscribing to online platforms offering customizable handbooks, or accessing free templates provided by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nWhen purchasing employee handbook templates specifically for Colorado businesses, employers should consider vendors that offer customization options to tailor policies to Colorado’s unique legal requirements, including the HFWA. Pricing for these templates varies widely, typically ranging from $100 to $500 for basic versions, with more comprehensive or subscription-based services costing more. Many providers offer add-ons such as regular legal updates, compliance alerts, and consultation services to help implement and maintain handbook policies effectively.\n\nTo select the right template, employers should evaluate whether the provider’s materials are regularly updated to reflect changes in Colorado labor laws, include clear guidance on HFWA compliance, and offer user-friendly customization tools.

Additionally, some legal service providers offer compliance software bundled with advisory support to help interpret and implement HFWA requirements effectively.\n\nEmployers adopting these tools benefit from improved accuracy in leave tracking, reduced risk of noncompliance penalties, streamlined employee communication, and enhanced ability to respond promptly to regulatory changes. When selecting a compliance platform, employers should consider factors such as ease of use, scalability, integration with existing systems, customer support, and the provider’s expertise in Colorado labor law.\n\n**Current Employee Benefits Trends and Strategic Considerations**  \nIn addition to compliance with the HFWA, Colorado employers are increasingly adapting their benefits offerings to meet evolving workforce needs and economic conditions in 2023.

Many providers offer add-ons such as regular legal updates, compliance alerts, and consultation services to help implement and maintain handbook policies effectively.\n\nTo select the right template, employers should evaluate whether the provider’s materials are regularly updated to reflect changes in Colorado labor laws, include clear guidance on HFWA compliance, and offer user-friendly customization tools. Implementation support, such as onboarding checklists or training materials, can further enhance the effectiveness of the handbook in communicating paid sick leave rights and employer responsibilities.\n\nIntegrating handbook templates into employee onboarding and ongoing communication strategies can enhance understanding and compliance with paid sick leave policies, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or violations. Employers are encouraged to review and update their handbooks regularly to ensure continued alignment with HFWA requirements and other applicable laws.\n\n**Compliance Technology and Legal Tools for HFWA Management**  \nTo further support compliance with the HFWA, many Colorado employers are turning to specialized legal compliance tools and software platforms designed to simplify the management of paid sick leave obligations. These technology solutions automate tracking of accrual, usage, carryover, and notice requirements, reducing administrative burdens and minimizing errors.\n\nPopular platforms often include features such as:  \n- Automated accrual calculations based on hours worked and employee classifications.  \n- Real-time leave balance tracking accessible to both employers and employees.  \n- Integrated notice and documentation management to ensure timely communication and compliance with HFWA posting and notification rules.  \n- Reporting tools that facilitate recordkeeping and audit readiness in line with Colorado’s two-year retention requirements.  \n- Alerts and updates reflecting changes in state labor laws and HFWA regulations to keep employers informed and compliant.  \n- Integration capabilities with payroll, timekeeping, and human resources information systems (HRIS) for seamless data synchronization.\n\nExamples of reputable compliance tools used by Colorado employers include platforms like BambooHR, Gusto, Zenefits, and Deputy, which offer modules or features tailored to paid sick leave management. Additionally, some legal service providers offer compliance software bundled with advisory support to help interpret and implement HFWA requirements effectively.\n\nEmployers adopting these tools benefit from improved accuracy in leave tracking, reduced risk of noncompliance penalties, streamlined employee communication, and enhanced ability to respond promptly to regulatory changes. When selecting a compliance platform, employers should consider factors such as ease of use, scalability, integration with existing systems, customer support, and the provider’s expertise in Colorado labor law.\n\n**Current Employee Benefits Trends and Strategic Considerations**  \nIn addition to compliance with the HFWA, Colorado employers are increasingly adapting their benefits offerings to meet evolving workforce needs and economic conditions in 2023. Key trends include:  \n- **Expansion of Mental Health Benefits:** Employers are broadening access to mental health services, including counseling, teletherapy, and wellness programs, recognizing the growing importance of mental well-being in employee productivity and retention.  \n- **Financial Wellness Programs:** Many employers are introducing or enhancing financial education, debt management, and retirement planning resources to support employees’ overall financial health.  \n- **Flexible Work Arrangements:** Remote work options, flexible scheduling, and hybrid models continue to be popular, helping employers attract and retain talent while accommodating diverse employee needs.  \n- **Family-Friendly Benefits:** Expanded parental leave, childcare support, and eldercare resources are increasingly offered to support employees balancing work and family responsibilities.  \n- **Voluntary Benefits:** Supplemental benefits such as pet insurance, identity theft protection, and legal assistance are gaining traction as cost-effective ways to enhance total rewards packages.  \n- **Talent Attraction and Retention Strategies:** Employers are leveraging comprehensive benefits packages, including paid sick leave compliance, to differentiate themselves in a competitive labor market, improve employee engagement, and reduce turnover.  \n\nThese trends reflect a broader shift toward holistic employee well-being and flexibility, influenced by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and changing workforce expectations. Employers who integrate HFWA compliance with these evolving benefits strategies position themselves to better meet employee needs and maintain a competitive advantage.\n\n**Colorado Secretary of State Business Resources**  \nThe Colorado Secretary of State plays a vital role in business formation, maintenance, and legislative oversight, providing essential resources that complement employer compliance efforts under the HFWA. Employers and business owners can access official business legislation pages, registration and filing services, and other regulatory information through the Secretary of State’s website.\n\nKey services include:  \n- **Business Registration and Filings:** Online portals for registering new businesses, filing annual and periodic reports, and maintaining good standing with the state. This includes trade name registration and other filings necessary for business operations.  \n- **Access to Business Legislation:** Comprehensive and up-to-date information on Colorado business laws, statutes, and administrative rules relevant to employers, available at [https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/businessHome.html](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/businessHome.html).  \n- **Compliance and Reporting Tools:** Resources to assist with ongoing business compliance, including licensing, regulatory filings, and reminders for required submissions.  \n- **Contact and Support:** Direct links and contact information for the Secretary of State’s office to assist with business-related inquiries and support navigating state requirements.\n\n**Colorado Labor Law Posters**  \nIn addition to these resources, employers must comply with legal posting requirements by displaying up-to-date labor law posters in the workplace. These posters inform employees of their rights under federal and state laws, including the HFWA, minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, OSHA safety regulations, and unemployment insurance. Colorado employers are required to post both state and federal labor law posters in a conspicuous location accessible to all employees.\n\nPosters typically include:  \n- **Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster:** Required under the HFWA to notify employees of their paid sick leave rights.  \n- **Federal Posters:** Such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) notices.  \n- **OSHA Posters:** Informing employees of workplace safety and health protections.\n\nEmployers can purchase official labor law posters from authorized vendors, including government agencies, professional HR service providers, and online retailers. Pricing generally ranges from $20 to $60 per poster set, depending on features such as laminated finishes, size (typically 18” x 24”), and inclusion of both state and federal notices. Many vendors offer subscription or update service programs that provide automatic delivery of revised posters and replacement sets to ensure ongoing compliance with changing laws.\n\nOrdering options typically include:  \n- **Single Purchase:** One-time purchase of a current poster set.  \n- **Subscription Services:** Annual or multi-year plans that guarantee updated posters are sent promptly when laws change.  \n- **Digital Versions:** Downloadable or printable posters for electronic display or in-office printing, often included with subscriptions.\n\nPopular and reputable poster providers serving Colorado employers include:  \n- **Colorado Department of Labor and Employment:** Offers official state posters and guidance.  \n- **U.S. Department of Labor:** Provides federal posters free of charge online.  \n- **Private Vendors:** Such as PosterCompliance, LaborLawCenter, HRdirect, and CompliancePoster, which offer bundled state and federal posters, laminated options, and update services.\n\nMaintaining current labor law posters is critical to avoid penalties and demonstrate compliance with workplace posting requirements. Employers should review and update posters annually or whenever new laws or regulations take effect. Utilizing vendor update services or integrating poster compliance into broader compliance platforms can simplify this process and reduce administrative burden.\n\nEmployers are encouraged to incorporate labor law poster compliance into their overall HFWA and workplace communication strategies. Displaying the Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster alongside other required notices helps ensure employees are fully informed of their rights and protections under the HFWA and related laws, supporting transparency and reducing risk of violations.\n\nEmployers and business owners are encouraged to utilize these official resources to ensure their business operations align with state requirements and to stay informed about legislative changes that may impact workplace policies, including those related to the HFWA. Regular consultation of these resources can help maintain compliance with evolving business laws and support effective management of employer obligations.\n\nFor more information, visit the Colorado Secretary of State’s official website at [https://www.sos.state.co.us](https://www.sos.state.co.us).\n\n***  \nJackson Lewis attorneys are available to assist employers in their compliance efforts.

      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "In 2023, Colorado enacted several significant labor law changes that reshape the employment landscape for both private and public sector employers. Key updates include:\n\n1. **Protecting Opportunities and Workers’ Rights (POWR) Act (SB 23-172)** – Effective August 7, 2023, this act broadens protections under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA). It lowers the standard for unlawful harassment by rejecting the federal “severe and pervasive” threshold, instead prohibiting any unwelcome conduct that is subjectively and objectively offensive based on protected classes, including the newly added category of marital status. The POWR Act also restricts nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) related to discriminatory practices, requiring NDAs to be mutual, allow disclosures to certain parties and government agencies, and imposes penalties for violations. Employers must now keep detailed records of discrimination complaints for at least five years. Additionally, the act modifies defenses available to employers in harassment and disability discrimination claims, tightening employer obligations to prevent and address harassment [1][6][10].\n\n2. **Job Application Fairness Act (JAFA) (SB 23-058)** – Starting July 1, 2024, employers are prohibited from asking applicants for age-related information on initial job applications, including birth dates and education attendance/graduation dates, to reduce age discrimination. Exceptions exist for verifying compliance with bona fide occupational qualifications. The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) enforces this law, with fines ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 for repeated violations [1][5][6][9][10].\n\n3. **Equal Pay for Equal Work Act Amendments (SB 23-105)** – Effective January 1, 2024, these amendments refine job posting and internal notification requirements. Employers must disclose specific compensation ranges, benefits, and application deadlines for job opportunities (excluding career progression roles). They must also announce selected candidates internally within 30 days, including job titles and how employees can express interest in similar roles. The statute of limitations for wage discrimination claims extends from three to six years. The CDLE is mandated to investigate wage discrimination complaints and mediate disputes [1][2][6][10].\n\n4. **Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) Amendments (SB 23-017)** – Effective August 7, 2023, employees may use paid sick leave for additional reasons such as grieving a family member’s death, attending funerals, handling related legal/financial matters, caring for family members affected by school or care closures due to inclement weather or emergencies, and evacuating residences under similar conditions. Employers must update sick leave policies accordingly [1][6][11].\n\n5. **Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) Act** – Effective January 1, 2024, Colorado provides paid family and medical leave benefits for up to 12 weeks (plus 4 additional weeks for pregnancy/childbirth complications). Employees can receive partial wage replacement and job protection during leave. Both employers and employees contribute premiums to fund the program [5][9][11].\n\n6. **Minimum Wage and Overtime** – The 2024 minimum wage in Colorado is $14.42 per hour, with higher rates for tipped employees, minors, and agricultural workers. Overtime thresholds for agricultural workers have been lowered to 50 hours per week in 2024, with further reductions planned. Paid breaks and heat safety requirements for agricultural workers are mandated [5].\n\n7. **Non-Compete and Restrictive Covenants** – Colorado continues to limit non-compete agreements, especially for lower-paid employees, with increased penalties for violations. Recent amendments enhance enforcement authority and regulate recovery of education and training expenses by employers [3][6][10].\n\n8. **Public Employees’ Workplace Protection Act (SB 23-111)** – Grants public sector employees expanded rights to discuss workplace issues, join employee organizations, and participate politically off duty, with protections against retaliation. Enforcement is by the CDLE, with phased effective dates starting August 7, 2023 [2][6].\n\n9. **Other Notable Laws** – Amendments to the CROWN Act prohibit discrimination based on hair length and texture; the Colorado Disability Opportunity Office was established to enhance protections for disabled individuals; and new biometric data privacy requirements will take effect in 2025 [9][10].\n\nEmployers in Colorado must review and update their policies, employment agreements, recordkeeping, and hiring practices to comply with these laws. The CDLE is increasingly active in enforcement, and penalties for noncompliance can include fines, damages, and litigation risks. Utilizing compliance tools and consulting with employment law experts is advisable to navigate this evolving legal environment [1][2][3][5][6][9][10][11].\n\n**Summary:**  \nColorado’s 2023 labor laws significantly expand employee protections in discrimination, harassment, pay equity, paid leave, and hiring fairness, while imposing stricter employer obligations on recordkeeping, nondisclosure agreements, and job posting transparency. These changes reflect Colorado’s position as a progressive state in employment law, emphasizing fairness, transparency, and worker rights [1][2][3][5][6][9][10][11].",
      "modified_content": "Colorado has enacted the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (SB20-205) (HFWA), which requires employers to provide earned paid sick leave to employees with specific provisions for accrual, usage, carryover, and expanded leave rights during public health emergencies.\n\n**Effective Dates and Employer Coverage**  \n- Employers with 16 or more employees must provide earned paid sick leave starting January 1, 2021.  \n- All employers, regardless of size, must comply starting January 1, 2022.  \n- Until December 31, 2020, employers must comply with the federal Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which provides up to 80 hours of COVID-19-related sick leave.

These templates provide a structured framework that includes essential policies such as paid sick leave provisions, notice requirements, and anti-retaliation protections. Using a well-crafted handbook template helps ensure consistency, legal compliance, and clear communication of employee rights and employer obligations. Employers can obtain these templates through various options, including purchasing from reputable legal or HR service providers, subscribing to online platforms offering customizable handbooks, or accessing free templates provided by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nWhen purchasing employee handbook templates specifically for Colorado businesses, employers should consider vendors that offer customization options to tailor policies to Colorado’s unique legal requirements, including the HFWA.

Many providers offer add-ons such as regular legal updates, compliance alerts, and consultation services to help implement and maintain handbook policies effectively.\n\nTo select the right template, employers should evaluate whether the provider’s materials are regularly updated to reflect changes in Colorado labor laws, include clear guidance on HFWA compliance, and offer user-friendly customization tools. Implementation support, such as onboarding checklists or training materials, can further enhance the effectiveness of the handbook in communicating paid sick leave rights and employer responsibilities.\n\nIntegrating handbook templates into employee onboarding and ongoing communication strategies can enhance understanding and compliance with paid sick leave policies, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or violations. Employers are encouraged to review and update their handbooks regularly to ensure continued alignment with HFWA requirements and other applicable laws.\n\n**Compliance Technology and Legal Tools for HFWA Management**  \nTo further support compliance with the HFWA, many Colorado employers are turning to specialized legal compliance tools and software platforms designed to simplify the management of paid sick leave obligations.

When selecting a compliance platform, employers should consider factors such as ease of use, scalability, integration with existing systems, customer support, and the provider’s expertise in Colorado labor law.\n\n**Current Employee Benefits Trends and Strategic Considerations**  \nIn addition to compliance with the HFWA, Colorado employers are increasingly adapting their benefits offerings to meet evolving workforce needs and economic conditions in 2023. Key trends include:  \n- **Expansion of Mental Health Benefits:** Employers are broadening access to mental health services, including counseling, teletherapy, and wellness programs, recognizing the growing importance of mental well-being in employee productivity and retention.  \n- **Financial Wellness Programs:** Many employers are introducing or enhancing financial education, debt management, and retirement planning resources to support employees’ overall financial health.  \n- **Flexible Work Arrangements:** Remote work options, flexible scheduling, and hybrid models continue to be popular, helping employers attract and retain talent while accommodating diverse employee needs.  \n- **Family-Friendly Benefits:** Expanded parental leave, childcare support, and eldercare resources are increasingly offered to support employees balancing work and family responsibilities.  \n- **Voluntary Benefits:** Supplemental benefits such as pet insurance, identity theft protection, and legal assistance are gaining traction as cost-effective ways to enhance total rewards packages.  \n- **Talent Attraction and Retention Strategies:** Employers are leveraging comprehensive benefits packages, including paid sick leave compliance, to differentiate themselves in a competitive labor market, improve employee engagement, and reduce turnover.  \n\nThese trends reflect a broader shift toward holistic employee well-being and flexibility, influenced by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and changing workforce expectations.

      "query": "overview of colorado paid sick leave law for businesses",
      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "Colorado’s paid sick leave law is governed by the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA), enacted in 2020 and effective in phases starting January 1, 2021, for employers with 16 or more employees, and January 1, 2022, for all employers regardless of size [2][6][11]. The law requires employers to provide accrued paid sick leave to employees working in Colorado, including part-time, temporary, and seasonal workers, but excluding independent contractors and certain government employees [6][8][11].\n\n**Accrual and Usage:**  \nEmployees accrue paid sick leave at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked, up to a cap of 48 hours per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit [2][6][11]. Employers may front-load the full 48 hours at the start of the year to satisfy accrual requirements but must still allow carryover of unused leave up to 48 hours to the following year [2][6][11]. Leave can be used as soon as it is accrued, and employees may take paid sick leave in one-hour increments unless the employer permits smaller increments [2][6][11].\n\n**Permissible Uses:**  \nEmployees may use accrued paid sick leave for:  \n- Their own physical or mental illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care;  \n- Caring for a family member with similar health needs;  \n- Recovering from or addressing domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment, including seeking medical attention, counseling, victim services, legal services, or relocation;  \n- Absences due to public health emergency orders closing the employee’s workplace or their child’s school or place of care;  \n- Additional uses added in 2023 include bereavement, attending funerals, handling legal/financial matters after a family member’s death, caring for family members affected by school or care closures due to inclement weather or other unexpected events, and evacuations due to such events [2][6][8][10][11].\n\n**Public Health Emergency (PHE) Leave:**  \nDuring a declared public health emergency (such as COVID-19), employers must supplement accrued sick leave with up to 80 hours of supplemental paid sick leave for full-time employees (pro-rated for part-time) [2][6][11]. This supplemental leave covers self-isolation, care for oneself or family members with symptoms or diagnosis, preventive care (including vaccinations), situations where public officials determine the employee’s presence would jeopardize others’ health, care for children or family members when schools or childcare are closed, and inability to work due to health conditions increasing susceptibility to the illness [2][6][11]. Employers cannot require documentation for PHE leave, and it may be used up to four weeks after the emergency ends [6][11].\n\n**Notice and Documentation:**  \nEmployees may request leave orally, in writing, electronically, or by any employer-accepted means [2][6][11]. Employers may adopt reasonable written notice policies for foreseeable leave but cannot deny leave for noncompliance with such policies [2][6][11]. For absences of four or more consecutive workdays, employers may require reasonable documentation but cannot require disclosure of details related to domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or health conditions [6][11].\n\n**Job Protection and Anti-Retaliation:**  \nEmployees’ jobs and benefits are protected when taking paid sick leave after 180 days of continuous employment; before that, leave can be used but without guaranteed job protection [4][6][11]. The law prohibits retaliation or discrimination against employees for using or requesting paid sick leave, with remedies including reinstatement and back pay [6][11].\n\n**Carryover and Separation:**  \nUnused accrued paid sick leave must carry over year to year up to 48 hours, but employers may limit annual usage to 48 hours [2][6][11]. Employers are not required to pay out unused sick leave upon separation but must reinstate unused leave if the employee is rehired within six months [2][6][11].\n\n**Recordkeeping and Posting:**  \nEmployers must maintain records documenting hours worked, paid sick leave accrued and used, and any denials for at least two years [6][11]. They must provide written notice of paid sick leave rights to employees at hire and post a state-approved notice in the workplace or electronically for remote workers, including in any language spoken by at least 5% of the workforce [6][11].\n\n**Coordination with Other Leave Policies:**  \nEmployers with existing paid leave policies that meet or exceed HFWA requirements may satisfy the law’s mandates without providing additional leave [2][6][11]. Collective bargaining agreements providing equivalent or more generous paid sick leave may exempt employees from HFWA coverage [6][8][11].\n\n**Enforcement and Penalties:**  \nThe Colorado Division of Labor Standards and Statistics enforces the HFWA. Violations can result in employee remedies such as back pay and reinstatement, as well as civil fines up to $100 per violation for notice and posting failures, with higher penalties for willful violations [6][11].\n\nIn summary, Colorado’s paid sick leave law mandates that all employers provide employees with accrued paid sick leave at a rate of one hour per 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours annually, with expanded leave rights during public health emergencies and for additional reasons such as bereavement and natural disasters. Employers must comply with accrual, usage, notice, recordkeeping, and anti-retaliation provisions to avoid penalties [2][4][6][8][10][11].  \n\nFor detailed compliance, employers often use employee handbook templates and legal compliance software to manage accruals, notices, and recordkeeping effectively [11].  \n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n[2] Colorado Enacts Legislation Requiring Employers to Provide Employees with Paid Sick Leave  \n[4] Colorado Paid Sick Leave Requirements: An HFWA Guide  \n[6] Colorado Passes Broad Paid Sick Leave Law  \n[8] Overview of Paid Sick Time Laws in the United States: Colorado  \n[10] Colorado Expands Paid Sick Leave (2023 Amendments)  \n[11] Comprehensive Summary of Colorado HFWA Paid Sick Leave Law",

The HFWA does not require compliance with the FFCRA’s Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act.\n\n**Employee Eligibility and Accrual**  \n- Employees begin accruing paid sick leave immediately upon hire and may use it as soon as it is accrued.  \n- Employees earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.  \n- Employers may front-load the full amount of paid sick leave at the start of the year to satisfy accrual requirements.  \n- Exempt employees working less than 40 hours per week accrue leave based on their normal workweek hours.\n\n**Permissible Reasons for Using Paid Sick Leave**  \nEmployees may use accrued paid sick leave for:  \n- Their own mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care.  \n- Caring for a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care.  \n- Recovering from or addressing issues related to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment, including seeking medical attention, victim services, counseling, relocation, or legal services.  \n- Absences due to public health emergency orders closing the employee’s workplace or their child’s school or place of care.\n\n**Usage and Notice Requirements**  \n- Paid sick leave must be taken in one-hour increments unless the employer allows smaller increments.  \n- Employers may loan paid sick leave to employees who have not yet accrued it.  \n- Employers cannot require employees to find a replacement worker as a condition for taking leave.  \n- Leave requests can be made orally, in writing, electronically, or by any employer-accepted means.  \n- Employers may adopt reasonable written notice policies for foreseeable leave but cannot deny leave for noncompliance. Employees should provide good faith notice and attempt to schedule leave to minimize business disruption.\n\n**Carryover and Separation**  \n- Employees may carry over up to 48 hours of unused paid sick leave to the next year, but employers may cap annual usage at 48 hours.  \n- Employers are not required to pay out unused sick leave upon separation.  \n- If an employee is rehired within six months, the employer must reinstate any unused accrued paid sick leave from prior employment.  \n- Paid sick leave may be recovered as a remedy for retaliatory personnel actions that prevented its use.\n\n**Paid Sick Leave During Public Health Emergencies**  \n- Employees receive a one-time supplemental leave grant during a declared public health emergency (e.g., COVID-19), defined as a bioterrorism act, pandemic influenza, or epidemic with a declared disaster emergency.  \n- Supplemental leave must be at least 80 hours for full-time employees or the equivalent of scheduled/average hours for part-time employees.  \n- This leave covers:  \n  - Self-isolation or care due to diagnosis or symptoms of the communicable illness causing the emergency.  \n  - Seeking medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care related to the illness.  \n  - Caring for family members who are self-isolating, symptomatic, diagnosed, or seeking preventive care.  \n  - Situations where public officials determine the employee or family member’s presence would jeopardize others’ health.  \n  - Caring for children or family members when childcare or schools are closed or unavailable due to the emergency.  \n  - Employee’s inability to work due to a health condition increasing susceptibility to the illness.  \n- Employers may count unused accrued paid time off toward this supplemental leave.  \n- Documentation cannot be required for this leave, and it may be used up to four weeks after the public health emergency ends.\n\n**Recordkeeping and Enforcement**  \n- Employers must retain records for two years documenting hours worked, paid sick leave accrued, and used.  \n- Colorado’s Division of Labor Standards and Statistics enforces HFWA compliance and will issue rules on compensation and accrual.  \n- Violations may result in compensation to employees and civil fines up to $100 per willful retaliation violation.  \n- Employees may file complaints with the Division or pursue civil action after notifying the employer and allowing 14 days for response.\n\n**Anti-Retaliation Protections**  \n- The HFWA prohibits retaliation against employees for using paid sick leave and provides remedies for adverse actions.\n\n**Notice to Employees**  \n- Employers must notify employees in writing of their paid sick leave rights per Division rules.  \n- Employers must post the Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster and distribute the Division’s Interpretive Notice & Formal Opinion #6A.  \n- Notices and posters must be provided in any language spoken by at least 5% of the workforce.  \n- Additional materials will be available for 2021 compliance.\n\n**Termination of Colorado Health Emergency Leave with Pay (HELP) Rules**  \n- The HELP Rules, which required up to two weeks of paid sick leave at two-thirds pay for COVID-19-related reasons, were terminated on July 14, 2020, the day before the HFWA took effect.  \n- The HELP Rules required employers to provide up to two weeks (up to a maximum of 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds of the employee’s regular rate of pay to employees with flu-like or respiratory illness symptoms who are being tested for COVID-19 or who are under instruction from a healthcare provider or authorized government official to quarantine or isolate due to a risk of having COVID-19.\n\n**Employee Handbook Templates**  \nTo assist employers in complying with the HFWA and other workplace regulations, employee handbook templates can be a valuable resource. These templates provide a structured framework that includes essential policies such as paid sick leave provisions, notice requirements, and anti-retaliation protections. Using a well-crafted handbook template helps ensure consistency, legal compliance, and clear communication of employee rights and employer obligations. Employers can obtain these templates through various options, including purchasing from reputable legal or HR service providers, subscribing to online platforms offering customizable handbooks, or accessing free templates provided by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nWhen purchasing employee handbook templates specifically for Colorado businesses, employers should consider vendors that offer customization options to tailor policies to Colorado’s unique legal requirements, including the HFWA. Pricing for these templates varies widely, typically ranging from $100 to $500 for basic versions, with more comprehensive or subscription-based services costing more. Many providers offer add-ons such as regular legal updates, compliance alerts, and consultation services to help implement and maintain handbook policies effectively.\n\nTo select the right template, employers should evaluate whether the provider’s materials are regularly updated to reflect changes in Colorado labor laws, include clear guidance on HFWA compliance, and offer user-friendly customization tools. Implementation support, such as onboarding checklists or training materials, can further enhance the effectiveness of the handbook in communicating paid sick leave rights and employer responsibilities.\n\nIntegrating handbook templates into employee onboarding and ongoing communication strategies can enhance understanding and compliance with paid sick leave policies, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or violations. Employers are encouraged to review and update their handbooks regularly to ensure continued alignment with HFWA requirements and other applicable laws.\n\n**Compliance Technology and Legal Tools for HFWA Management**  \nTo further support compliance with the HFWA, many Colorado employers are turning to specialized legal compliance tools and software platforms designed to simplify the management of paid sick leave obligations. These technology solutions automate tracking of accrual, usage, carryover, and notice requirements, reducing administrative burdens and minimizing errors.\n\nPopular platforms often include features such as:  \n- Automated accrual calculations based on hours worked and employee classifications.  \n- Real-time leave balance tracking accessible to both employers and employees.  \n- Integrated notice and documentation management to ensure timely communication and compliance with HFWA posting and notification rules.  \n- Reporting tools that facilitate recordkeeping and audit readiness in line with Colorado’s two-year retention requirements.  \n- Alerts and updates reflecting changes in state labor laws and HFWA regulations to keep employers informed and compliant.  \n- Integration capabilities with payroll, timekeeping, and human resources information systems (HRIS) for seamless data synchronization.\n\nExamples of reputable compliance tools used by Colorado employers include platforms like BambooHR, Gusto, Zenefits, and Deputy, which offer modules or features tailored to paid sick leave management. Additionally, some legal service providers offer compliance software bundled with advisory support to help interpret and implement HFWA requirements effectively.\n\nEmployers adopting these tools benefit from improved accuracy in leave tracking, reduced risk of noncompliance penalties, streamlined employee communication, and enhanced ability to respond promptly to regulatory changes. When selecting a compliance platform, employers should consider factors such as ease of use, scalability, integration with existing systems, customer support, and the provider’s expertise in Colorado labor law.\n\n**Current Employee Benefits Trends and Strategic Considerations**  \nIn addition to compliance with the HFWA, Colorado employers are increasingly adapting their benefits offerings to meet evolving workforce needs and economic conditions in 2023. Key trends include:  \n- **Expansion of Mental Health Benefits:** Employers are broadening access to mental health services, including counseling, teletherapy, and wellness programs, recognizing the growing importance of mental well-being in employee productivity and retention.  \n- **Financial Wellness Programs:** Many employers are introducing or enhancing financial education, debt management, and retirement planning resources to support employees’ overall financial health.  \n- **Flexible Work Arrangements:** Remote work options, flexible scheduling, and hybrid models continue to be popular, helping employers attract and retain talent while accommodating diverse employee needs.  \n- **Family-Friendly Benefits:** Expanded parental leave, childcare support, and eldercare resources are increasingly offered to support employees balancing work and family responsibilities.  \n- **Voluntary Benefits:** Supplemental benefits such as pet insurance, identity theft protection, and legal assistance are gaining traction as cost-effective ways to enhance total rewards packages.  \n- **Talent Attraction and Retention Strategies:** Employers are leveraging comprehensive benefits packages, including paid sick leave compliance, to differentiate themselves in a competitive labor market, improve employee engagement, and reduce turnover.  \n\nThese trends reflect a broader shift toward holistic employee well-being and flexibility, influenced by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and changing workforce expectations. Employers who integrate HFWA compliance with these evolving benefits strategies position themselves to better meet employee needs and maintain a competitive advantage.\n\n**Colorado Secretary of State Business Resources**  \nThe Colorado Secretary of State plays a vital role in business formation, maintenance, and legislative oversight, providing essential resources that complement employer compliance efforts under the HFWA. Employers and business owners can access official business legislation pages, registration and filing services, and other regulatory information through the Secretary of State’s website.\n\nKey services include:  \n- **Business Registration and Filings:** Online portals for registering new businesses, filing annual and periodic reports, and maintaining good standing with the state. This includes trade name registration and other filings necessary for business operations.  \n- **Access to Business Legislation:** Comprehensive and up-to-date information on Colorado business laws, statutes, and administrative rules relevant to employers, available at [https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/businessHome.html](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/businessHome.html).  \n- **Compliance and Reporting Tools:** Resources to assist with ongoing business compliance, including licensing, regulatory filings, and reminders for required submissions.  \n- **Contact and Support:** Direct links and contact information for the Secretary of State’s office to assist with business-related inquiries and support navigating state requirements.\n\n**Colorado Labor Law Posters**  \nIn addition to these resources, employers must comply with legal posting requirements by displaying up-to-date labor law posters in the workplace. These posters inform employees of their rights under federal and state laws, including the HFWA, minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, OSHA safety regulations, and unemployment insurance. Colorado employers are required to post both state and federal labor law posters in a conspicuous location accessible to all employees.\n\nPosters typically include:  \n- **Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster:** Required under the HFWA to notify employees of their paid sick leave rights.  \n- **Federal Posters:** Such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) notices.  \n- **OSHA Posters:** Informing employees of workplace safety and health protections.\n\nEmployers can purchase official labor law posters from authorized vendors, including government agencies, professional HR service providers, and online retailers. Pricing generally ranges from $20 to $60 per poster set, depending on features such as laminated finishes, size (typically 18” x 24”), and inclusion of both state and federal notices. Many vendors offer subscription or update service programs that provide automatic delivery of revised posters and replacement sets to ensure ongoing compliance with changing laws.\n\nOrdering options typically include:  \n- **Single Purchase:** One-time purchase of a current poster set.  \n- **Subscription Services:** Annual or multi-year plans that guarantee updated posters are sent promptly when laws change.  \n- **Digital Versions:** Downloadable or printable posters for electronic display or in-office printing, often included with subscriptions.\n\nPopular and reputable poster providers serving Colorado employers include:  \n- **Colorado Department of Labor and Employment:** Offers official state posters and guidance.  \n- **U.S. Department of Labor:** Provides federal posters free of charge online.  \n- **Private Vendors:** Such as PosterCompliance, LaborLawCenter, HRdirect, and CompliancePoster, which offer bundled state and federal posters, laminated options, and update services.\n\nMaintaining current labor law posters is critical to avoid penalties and demonstrate compliance with workplace posting requirements. Employers should review and update posters annually or whenever new laws or regulations take effect. Utilizing vendor update services or integrating poster compliance into broader compliance platforms can simplify this process and reduce administrative burden.\n\nEmployers are encouraged to incorporate labor law poster compliance into their overall HFWA and workplace communication strategies. Displaying the Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster alongside other required notices helps ensure employees are fully informed of their rights and protections under the HFWA and related laws, supporting transparency and reducing risk of violations.\n\nEmployers and business owners are encouraged to utilize these official resources to ensure their business operations align with state requirements and to stay informed about legislative changes that may impact workplace policies, including those related to the HFWA. Regular consultation of these resources can help maintain compliance with evolving business laws and support effective management of employer obligations.\n\nFor more information, visit the Colorado Secretary of State’s official website at [https://www.sos.state.co.us](https://www.sos.state.co.us).\n\n***  \nJackson Lewis attorneys are available to assist employers in their compliance efforts.

      "query": "overview of new sick leave laws in colorado 2023",
      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "In 2023, Colorado expanded its paid sick leave law under the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA) through Senate Bill 23-017, signed by Governor Jared Polis on June 2, 2023, with amendments effective August 7, 2023. This expansion broadens the qualifying reasons for which employees can use accrued paid sick leave, requiring all Colorado employers to allow eligible employees to use paid sick leave for the following new purposes:\n\n1. To grieve, attend funeral services or memorials, or handle financial and legal matters following the death of a covered family member.\n2. To care for a family member whose school or place of care has been closed due to inclement weather, loss of power, heating, water, or other unexpected events causing closure.\n3. To evacuate the employee’s residence due to inclement weather, loss of utilities, or other unexpected events necessitating evacuation.\n\nThese new reasons are in addition to the original HFWA uses, which include the employee’s own illness or preventive care, caring for a family member’s illness or preventive care, absences related to domestic abuse or harassment, and absences due to public health emergency closures of workplaces or schools [1][2][3][4][6][7][8].\n\nAdditionally, the Colorado public health emergency leave (PHEL) benefit, which provided up to 80 hours of paid leave during declared public health emergencies (notably COVID-19), ended for COVID-19-related absences as of June 9, 2023. However, PHEL remains in effect for future qualifying public health emergencies declared by authorities [1][3][10][11].\n\nKey features of the HFWA include:\n\n- Paid sick leave accrual at a minimum rate of one hour per 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours per year, with carryover of unused leave up to 48 hours.\n- Employers must pay employees their regular hourly rate for sick leave hours used.\n- Reasonable documentation may be requested only if leave exceeds four consecutive workdays.\n- Employers must update sick leave policies and workplace postings to reflect the expanded leave reasons by August 7, 2023.\n- The law applies to all employers regardless of size, covering full-time, part-time, temporary, and migratory workers, excluding federal employees [2][3][7][8].\n\nEmployers are advised to review and revise their sick leave policies, attendance, anti-retaliation, and discipline policies to ensure compliance with the expanded HFWA provisions. They must also provide written notice to employees about their rights under the HFWA and display updated informational posters in the workplace [1][2][3][9].\n\nThe HFWA is distinct from Colorado’s Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program, which provides partial wage replacement for longer-term family and medical leave but does not cover bereavement or inclement weather-related absences. HFWA sick leave is paid in full by employers and can be used for minor illnesses without medical certification, whereas FAMLI requires health provider verification and offers partial pay through state benefits [4].\n\nIn summary, the 2023 changes to Colorado’s sick leave laws under the HFWA significantly expand employee protections by adding bereavement and weather-related reasons for paid sick leave use, while ending COVID-19-specific public health emergency leave. Employers must update policies and notices accordingly to remain compliant with these new requirements effective August 7, 2023 [1][2][3][4][6][7][9].",

      "query": "how does paid sick leave work in colorado for small businesses",
      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "In Colorado, paid sick leave for small businesses is governed by the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA), which requires all employers—regardless of size—to provide paid sick leave to their employees starting January 1, 2022. This means even small businesses must comply with the law’s provisions [1][4][6][11].\n\n**Accrual and Usage:**  \nEmployees accrue paid sick leave at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours (6 days) per year. Accrual begins immediately on the first day of employment, and employees may use their accrued leave as it accumulates. Employers may also choose to frontload the full 48 hours at the start of the year instead of tracking accruals [1][4][6][11].\n\n**Carryover and Caps:**  \nUnused sick leave can be carried over to the next year, but employers can limit the amount of leave used annually to 48 hours. If an employee separates and is rehired within six months, the employer must reinstate any unused accrued leave unless it was paid out at separation [1][4][6][11].\n\n**Permitted Reasons for Leave:**  \nEmployees can use paid sick leave for a broad range of reasons, including:  \n- Their own physical or mental illness, injury, or health condition, including medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care.  \n- Caring for a family member (including children, spouses/domestic partners, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, and siblings) with similar health needs.  \n- Situations related to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment, such as seeking medical attention, counseling, legal services, or relocation.  \n- Absences due to workplace or child’s school/place of care closure during a public health emergency.  \n- Additional reasons recently added include bereavement and care related to inclement weather or utility loss requiring evacuation or care for family members affected by school or care closures [1][4][5][6][11].\n\n**Public Health Emergency (PHE) Leave:**  \nDuring declared public health emergencies, employers must provide supplemental paid sick leave of up to 80 hours (pro-rated for part-time employees) in addition to accrued leave. This leave covers COVID-19 or other communicable disease-related needs such as self-isolation, vaccination, or caring for affected family members. PHE leave is available immediately upon declaration and remains available for four weeks after the emergency ends. Employers cannot require documentation for PHE leave [1][4][6][11].\n\n**Employer Obligations:**  \nSmall businesses must:  \n- Provide written notice to employees about their paid sick leave rights, including posting required posters in visible locations or electronically for remote workers.  \n- Track hours worked, sick leave accrued, and leave used, retaining records for at least two years.  \n- Prohibit retaliation against employees for using sick leave or asserting their rights under HFWA.  \n- Allow leave requests to be made orally, in writing, or electronically, and may require reasonable documentation only for absences of four or more consecutive days (except for PHE leave) [1][2][4][6][11].\n\n**Exemptions:**  \nIndependent contractors and employees working less than 30 days per year are generally exempt. Federal employees and those covered by collective bargaining agreements may have different rules [1][2][4][6].\n\n**Compliance and Penalties:**  \nFailure to comply can result in penalties starting at $50 per violation, escalating for willful or repeated violations. Employers are encouraged to maintain clear policies, train management, and use compliance tools or software to manage accruals and recordkeeping effectively [2][4][6][11].\n\nIn summary, small businesses in Colorado must provide paid sick leave accruing at one hour per 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours annually, usable for a wide range of health and safety-related reasons, with additional leave during public health emergencies. Employers must track and notify employees of their rights, maintain records, and protect employees from retaliation to remain compliant with HFWA [1][2][4][5][6][11].",

      "success": true,
      "final_answer": "The best resources for understanding Colorado sick leave laws center around the state's Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA), which mandates paid sick leave for nearly all Colorado employees and employers. Key authoritative and comprehensive resources include:\n\n1. **Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE)**  \n   The CDLE provides official guidance, FAQs, posters, and interpretive notices on the HFWA, including detailed explanations of accrual, usage, employer obligations, and anti-retaliation protections. Their website hosts updated bulletins and formal opinions that clarify compliance requirements and enforcement procedures. For example, CDLE’s INFO #6B document summarizes employer and employee rights and obligations under HFWA, including accrual rates (1 hour per 30 worked hours, up to 48 hours/year), permissible uses of leave, and documentation rules for absences over four days [6][9][11].\n\n2. **Patriot Software Blog**  \n   This resource offers a clear, practical overview of Colorado’s paid sick leave law, including accrual rates, qualifying reasons for leave (such as mental or physical illness, domestic violence, public health emergency closures, bereavement, and inclement weather), employer coverage (all employers regardless of size), carryover rules, and documentation requirements. It also links to official CDLE resources for further details [1].\n\n3. **Justworks Help Center**  \n   Justworks provides a detailed explanation of Colorado’s sick and safe leave under HFWA, including accrual or front-loading options, usage reasons, documentation policies, and best practices for employers to set up compliant leave policies. It also links to CDLE’s official paid sick leave resources and posters [2].\n\n4. **TCWGlobal Blog**  \n   This source offers an in-depth, up-to-date summary of the HFWA, including the law’s history, accrual and carryover rules, covered family members, public health emergency leave provisions (up to 80 hours supplemental leave during declared emergencies), employer obligations such as notice and recordkeeping, and common FAQs. It emphasizes the broad coverage of the law, including part-time and temporary workers, and clarifies misconceptions about sick leave use and reset [4].\n\n5. **SixFifty Employment Law Platform**  \n   SixFifty provides a legal expert’s guide to Colorado paid sick leave, explaining accrual, usage, employer and employee rights, documentation, notice requirements, and the interaction with other leave policies. It also highlights the supplemental leave during public health emergencies and the protections against retaliation. This resource is useful for employers seeking compliance tools and legal clarity [10].\n\n6. **Colorado Dental Association (CDA) Summary**  \n   The CDA offers a concise explanation tailored for employers, including accrual rates, usage reasons, public health emergency leave, documentation requirements, and the interplay with Colorado’s paid family medical leave program (Proposition 118). It also provides links to official CDLE bulletins and posters [7].\n\n7. **Additional CDLE Published Guidance**  \n   The CDLE’s Labor Law Guidance & Education page includes interpretive notices, formal opinions, and one-page summaries (INFOs and KNOWLEDGEs) that provide authoritative explanations on wage and hour laws, including paid sick leave under HFWA. These documents are essential for employers and employees seeking detailed legal interpretations and enforcement information [6][9].\n\n**Summary of Key Legal Points from These Resources:**  \n- All Colorado employers must provide paid sick leave to employees (full-time, part-time, temporary) starting January 1, 2022, regardless of employer size [1][4][7][11].  \n- Employees accrue at least 1 hour of paid sick leave per 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours per year, with carryover of unused leave up to 48 hours [1][4][7][11].  \n- Leave can be used for personal or family mental or physical illness, injury, medical care, domestic violence-related needs, public health emergency closures, bereavement, and weather-related emergencies [1][2][3][4][11].  \n- Employers may frontload leave but must still allow carryover; they can limit annual usage to 48 hours [1][4][10].  \n- Documentation can only be required for absences of four or more consecutive days, and employers cannot require disclosure of specific medical or domestic violence details [1][2][3][10].  \n- During declared public health emergencies, employees are entitled to supplemental paid sick leave (up to 80 hours for full-time workers) for related health needs, with no documentation required [3][4][7][11].  \n- Employers must provide written notice of rights and post official HFWA posters in English and other languages spoken by at least 5% of employees [2][6][10].  \n- Retaliation against employees for using sick leave is prohibited, with enforcement by the Colorado Division of Labor Standards and Statistics [3][6][9][11].\n\n**In conclusion,** for a thorough and reliable understanding of Colorado sick leave laws, the best approach is to consult the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment’s official resources and bulletins, supplemented by practical guides from reputable HR and legal platforms such as Patriot Software, Justworks, TCWGlobal, SixFifty, and professional associations like the Colorado Dental Association.

      "modified_content": "Colorado has enacted the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (SB20-205) (HFWA), which requires employers to provide earned paid sick leave to employees with specific provisions for accrual, usage, carryover, and expanded leave rights during public health emergencies.\n\n**Effective Dates and Employer Coverage**  \n- Employers with 16 or more employees must provide earned paid sick leave starting January 1, 2021.  \n- All employers, regardless of size, must comply starting January 1, 2022.  \n- Until December 31, 2020, employers must comply with the federal Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which provides up to 80 hours of COVID-19-related sick leave. The HFWA does not require compliance with the FFCRA’s Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act.\n\n**Employee Eligibility and Accrual**  \n- Employees begin accruing paid sick leave immediately upon hire and may use it as soon as it is accrued.  \n- Employees earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to 48 hours per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.  \n- Employers may front-load the full amount of paid sick leave at the start of the year to satisfy accrual requirements.  \n- Exempt employees working less than 40 hours per week accrue leave based on their normal workweek hours.\n\n**Permissible Reasons for Using Paid Sick Leave**  \nEmployees may use accrued paid sick leave for:  \n- Their own mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care.  \n- Caring for a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, health condition, medical diagnosis, care, treatment, or preventive care.  \n- Recovering from or addressing issues related to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment, including seeking medical attention, victim services, counseling, relocation, or legal services.  \n- Absences due to public health emergency orders closing the employee’s workplace or their child’s school or place of care.\n\n**Usage and Notice Requirements**  \n- Paid sick leave must be taken in one-hour increments unless the employer allows smaller increments.  \n- Employers may loan paid sick leave to employees who have not yet accrued it.  \n- Employers cannot require employees to find a replacement worker as a condition for taking leave.  \n- Leave requests can be made orally, in writing, electronically, or by any employer-accepted means.  \n- Employers may adopt reasonable written notice policies for foreseeable leave but cannot deny leave for noncompliance.
