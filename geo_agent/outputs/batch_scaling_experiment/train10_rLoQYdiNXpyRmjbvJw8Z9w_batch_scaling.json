    "original": "Difference between Management and Administration\nKey difference: Administration frames the objectives and policies of an organization. Management implements these policies and objectives.\nManagement and administration are at times used interchangeably; however, they are two different levels of the organization. The administration is the top level of the organization with the decisive functions. They are responsible for determining the policies and objectives of the organization or the firm. Management, on the other hand is the middle level executive function. They implement the policies and objectives as decided by the administration.\nThe administration includes the people who are either owners or partners of the firm. They usually contribute to the firm’s capital and earn profits or returns on their investment. The main administrative function is handling the business aspects of the firm, such as finance. Other administrative functions usually include planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling and budgeting. Administration must integrate leadership and vision, to organize the people and resources, in order to achieve common goals and objectives for the organization.\nManagement usually incorporates the employees of the firm who use their skills for the firm in return for remuneration. Management is responsible for carrying out the strategies of the administration. Motivation is the key factor of a management. Management must motivate and handle the employees. It can be said that management is directly under the control of administration.\nFurther comparison between management and administration:\n|\n|\nManagement |\nAdministration |\n|\nDefinition |\nArt of getting things done through others by directing their efforts towards achievement of pre-determined goals. |\nFormulation of broad objectives, plans & policies. |\n|\nNature |\nexecuting function, doing function |\ndecision-making function, thinking function |\n|\nScope |\nDecisions within the framework set by the administration. |\nMajor decisions of an enterprise as a whole. |\n|\nLevel of authority |\nMiddle level activity |\nTop level activity |\n|\nStatus |\nGroup of managerial personnel who use their specialized knowledge to fulfill the objectives of an enterprise. |\nConsists of owners who invest capital in and receive profits from an enterprise. |\n|\nUsage |\nUsed in business enterprises. |\nPopular with government, military, educational, and religious organizations. |\n|\nInfluence |\nDecisions are influenced by the values, opinions, beliefs and decisions of the managers. |\nInfluenced by public opinion, government policies, customs etc. |\n|\nMain functions |\nMotivating and controlling |\nPlanning and organizing |\n|\nAbilities |\nHandles the employees. |\nHandles the business aspects such as finance. |\nComments\nOlaa Michael\nThu, 08/24/2017 - 20:48\nTsehay\nMon, 08/21/2017 - 23:46\nTeja\nWed, 07/12/2017 - 20:27\ns.sangavi\nSat, 07/08/2017 - 13:28\naman\nThu, 05/04/2017 - 20:04\nAbdinasir\nSun, 10/23/2016 - 01:41\nAxel\nSun, 07/17/2016 - 10:07\nKayawe Patrrick\nSun, 07/03/2016 - 23:04\nJahanzaib Marwat\nFri, 05/13/2016 - 20:43\nkusum\nFri, 12/18/2015 - 01:38\nPages\nAdd new comment",
    "optimized": "Difference between Management and Administration\n\nThe fundamental distinction between administration and management lies in their roles within an organization: administration sets broad objectives and policies at the top level, while management focuses on executing these policies at the middle level.\n\n### Administration  \n- Comprises owners or partners who invest capital and earn profits.  \n- Responsible for decision-making, planning, and organizing business aspects such as finance.  \n- Involves framing broad objectives, plans, and policies.  \n- Functions include planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling, and budgeting.  \n- Integrates leadership and vision to organize people and resources to achieve organizational goals.  \n- Operates at the top level with decisive authority.  \n- Influenced by public opinion, government policies, customs, and other external factors.  \n- Commonly associated with government, military, educational, and religious organizations.\n\n### Management  \n- Consists of employees who apply their skills in return for remuneration.  \n- Responsible for implementing the strategies and policies set by administration.  \n- Focuses on motivating and directing employees to achieve the set goals.  \n- Functions primarily involve motivating and controlling personnel.  \n- Operates at the middle level, executing decisions within the framework established by administration.  \n- Decisions are influenced by the values, opinions, and beliefs of managers.  \n- Predominantly used in business enterprises.\n\n| Aspect             | Administration                                                      | Management                                               |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Definition         | Formulation of broad objectives, plans, and policies               | Art of getting things done through others by directing efforts towards goals |\n| Nature             | Decision-making and thinking function                              | Executing and doing function                              |\n| Scope              | Major decisions affecting the enterprise as a whole               | Decisions within the framework set by administration     |\n| Level of Authority | Top-level activity                                                 | Middle-level activity                                     |\n| Status             | Owners who invest capital and receive profits                      | Managerial personnel using specialized knowledge         |\n| Usage              | Government, military, educational, religious sectors              | Business enterprises                                      |\n| Influence          | Influenced by public opinion, government policies, customs        | Influenced by managers’ values, opinions, and beliefs    |\n| Main Functions     | Planning and organizing                                            | Motivating and controlling                                |\n| Abilities          | Handles business aspects such as finance                           | Handles employees                                         |\n\n### Integration of Governance Frameworks and the World Bank’s Role  \nThe distinction between administration and management is further clarified through governance frameworks promoted by international organizations like the World Bank. The World Bank supports good governance by providing data, analysis, and assistance for governance reforms globally. A key tool is the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), which assess governance performance across countries based on dimensions such as voice and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption.\n\nThese governance indicators assist administrations—especially at the top level—in formulating policies and objectives that promote transparency, accountability, and effective management. Concurrently, management at various levels uses these frameworks to implement governance policies, ensuring organizational goals align with broader governance standards. Thus, the World Bank’s governance initiatives reinforce the distinct but complementary roles of administration and management by equipping administrations with tools for policy formulation and supporting management in effective policy execution.\n\nBy integrating governance frameworks like the WGI, organizations and governments can better fulfill their administrative responsibilities in setting policies that foster good governance, while management concentrates on the practical implementation of these policies to achieve desired outcomes."
