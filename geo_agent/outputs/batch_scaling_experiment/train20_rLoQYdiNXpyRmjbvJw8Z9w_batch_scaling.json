    "original": "Difference between Management and Administration\nKey difference: Administration frames the objectives and policies of an organization. Management implements these policies and objectives.\nManagement and administration are at times used interchangeably; however, they are two different levels of the organization. The administration is the top level of the organization with the decisive functions. They are responsible for determining the policies and objectives of the organization or the firm. Management, on the other hand is the middle level executive function. They implement the policies and objectives as decided by the administration.\nThe administration includes the people who are either owners or partners of the firm. They usually contribute to the firm’s capital and earn profits or returns on their investment. The main administrative function is handling the business aspects of the firm, such as finance. Other administrative functions usually include planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling and budgeting. Administration must integrate leadership and vision, to organize the people and resources, in order to achieve common goals and objectives for the organization.\nManagement usually incorporates the employees of the firm who use their skills for the firm in return for remuneration. Management is responsible for carrying out the strategies of the administration. Motivation is the key factor of a management. Management must motivate and handle the employees. It can be said that management is directly under the control of administration.\nFurther comparison between management and administration:\n|\n|\nManagement |\nAdministration |\n|\nDefinition |\nArt of getting things done through others by directing their efforts towards achievement of pre-determined goals. |\nFormulation of broad objectives, plans & policies. |\n|\nNature |\nexecuting function, doing function |\ndecision-making function, thinking function |\n|\nScope |\nDecisions within the framework set by the administration. |\nMajor decisions of an enterprise as a whole. |\n|\nLevel of authority |\nMiddle level activity |\nTop level activity |\n|\nStatus |\nGroup of managerial personnel who use their specialized knowledge to fulfill the objectives of an enterprise. |\nConsists of owners who invest capital in and receive profits from an enterprise. |\n|\nUsage |\nUsed in business enterprises. |\nPopular with government, military, educational, and religious organizations. |\n|\nInfluence |\nDecisions are influenced by the values, opinions, beliefs and decisions of the managers. |\nInfluenced by public opinion, government policies, customs etc. |\n|\nMain functions |\nMotivating and controlling |\nPlanning and organizing |\n|\nAbilities |\nHandles the employees. |\nHandles the business aspects such as finance. |\nComments\nOlaa Michael\nThu, 08/24/2017 - 20:48\nTsehay\nMon, 08/21/2017 - 23:46\nTeja\nWed, 07/12/2017 - 20:27\ns.sangavi\nSat, 07/08/2017 - 13:28\naman\nThu, 05/04/2017 - 20:04\nAbdinasir\nSun, 10/23/2016 - 01:41\nAxel\nSun, 07/17/2016 - 10:07\nKayawe Patrrick\nSun, 07/03/2016 - 23:04\nJahanzaib Marwat\nFri, 05/13/2016 - 20:43\nkusum\nFri, 12/18/2015 - 01:38\nPages\nAdd new comment",
    "optimized": "Difference between Management and Administration  \n==================================================\n\n**Key Distinction**  \n- **Administration** involves top-level decision-making, setting broad organizational objectives, policies, and plans.  \n- **Management** operates at the middle level, implementing these directives by directing and motivating employees.\n\nOverview  \n--------  \nManagement and administration, though often used interchangeably, represent distinct organizational levels and functions. Administration focuses on decision-making and planning at the top level, while management executes these policies and objectives at the middle level.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities  \n--------------------------  \n### Administration  \n- Comprised of owners or partners who invest capital and earn profits or returns.  \n- Sets broad objectives, plans, and policies for the organization.  \n- Engages in decision-making, planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling, and budgeting.  \n- Provides leadership and vision to align people and resources toward common goals.  \n- Manages business aspects such as finance.  \n- Acts as the primary thinking and decision-making entity.  \n- Influenced by external factors like public opinion, government policies, and customs.  \n- Commonly associated with government, military, educational, and religious organizations.  \n- Holds top-level authority.\n\n### Management  \n- Consists of employees applying their skills in exchange for remuneration.  \n- Implements strategies and policies formulated by administration.  \n- Focuses on motivating, directing, and controlling employees to achieve organizational goals.  \n- Primarily an executing and doing function.  \n- Decisions are influenced by managers’ values, opinions, and beliefs.  \n- Operates within the framework set by administration.  \n- Commonly used in business enterprises.  \n- Holds middle-level authority.\n\n### Supervision in Small Businesses  \n- **Supervision** refers to the direct oversight of employees’ day-to-day activities, ensuring tasks are performed correctly and efficiently.  \n- **Supervisors** are frontline personnel responsible for monitoring work, providing immediate guidance, and addressing operational issues.  \n- In small business environments, supervisors often have a hands-on role, bridging the gap between management and employees.  \n- Unlike management, which involves planning, organizing, and motivating at a broader level, supervision focuses on direct control and support of employee performance.  \n- Supervisors report to managers and help implement management’s directives on the ground.  \n- Their responsibilities include scheduling work, training employees, resolving conflicts, and ensuring quality standards are met.  \n- Supervision is more task-oriented and operational, whereas management encompasses broader responsibilities including strategic execution and employee motivation.  \n- In small businesses, the roles of supervisor and manager may overlap due to limited personnel, but the distinction remains in scope and authority.\n\nDetailed Comparison between Management and Administration  \n---------------------------------------------------------  \n\n| Aspect
