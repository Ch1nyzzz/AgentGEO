    "original": "Colorado has enacted the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (SB20-205) (HFWA) to require employers to provide employees with up to six days, or up to 48 hours, of earned paid sick leave.\nEmployers with at least 16 employees must begin providing earned paid sick leave on January 1, 2021. All employers, regardless of size, must begin providing earned paid sick leave effective January 1, 2022.\nEffective immediately, the HFWA requires that employers, regardless of size, comply with the federal Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which stays in effect until December 31, 2020. The Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act provides up to 80 hours of sick leave for COVID-19-related reasons. The HFWA does not require employers to comply with the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act of the FFCRA, which provides 12 weeks of pay to care for children whose school or place of care is closed, or childcare provider is unavailable, because of COVID-19-related reasons.\nColorado’s Division of Labor Standards and Statistics will have the authority to enforce the requirements of the HFWA. The Division will be providing rules regarding compensation and accrual of paid sick leave under the HFWA.\nEmployee Eligibility\nEmployees immediately begin to accrue paid sick leave upon hire and may use sick leave as soon as it is accrued.\nHow Employees Accrue Paid Sick Leave\nEach employee earns at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours the employee works, up to 48 hours of paid sick leave per year, unless the employer selects a higher limit.\nAn employer may satisfy the accrual requirements of the HFWA by providing the employee with an amount of paid sick leave that meets or exceeds the requirements of the HFWA at the beginning of the year.\nExempt employees who work less than a 40-hour workweek accrue paid sick leave based on the number of hours that comprise the employee’s normal workweek.\nReasons for Taking Accrued Paid Sick Leave\nEmployees may use accrued paid sick leave for the following reasons:\nThe employee:\n(i) Has a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition that prevents the employee from working;\n(ii) Needs to obtain a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or\n(iii) Needs to obtain preventive medical care.\nThe employee needs to care for a family member who:\n(i) Has a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition;\n(ii) Needs to obtain a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or\n(iii) Needs to obtain preventive medical care.\nThe employee or the employee’s family member has been the victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment and the use of leave is to:\n(i) Seek medical attention for the employee or the employee’s family member to recover from a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition caused by the domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment;\n(ii) Obtain services from a victim services organization;\n(iii) Obtain mental health or other counseling;\n(iv) Seek relocation due to the domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment; or\n(v) Seek legal services, including preparation for or participation in a civil or criminal proceeding relating to or resulting from the domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment;\nDue to a public health emergency, a public official has ordered closure of:\n(i) The employee’s place of business; or\n(ii) The school or place of care of the employee’s child and the employee needs to be absent from work to care for the employee’s child.\nTaking Paid Sick Leave\nEmployees must take paid sick leave in one-hour increments, unless the employer permits employees to take leave in smaller increments. Employers may loan paid sick leave to an employee who has not yet accrued it.\nEmployers may not require, as a condition of taking paid sick leave, that the employee search for and find a replacement worker to cover the employee’s paid sick leave.\nRequests for accrued paid sick leave must be made orally, in writing, electronically, or by any other means acceptable to the employer. When possible, the employee must include the expected duration of the absence. An employer may adopt a written policy that contains reasonable procedures for the employee to provide notice when the use of paid sick leave taken under the HFWA is foreseeable; however, an employer cannot deny paid sick leave to the employee based on noncompliance with such a policy. When the leave is foreseeable, employees should make a good faith effort to provide notice to the employer and make a reasonable effort to schedule paid sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt business operations.\nCarry Over of Accrued Paid Sick Leave\nEmployees may carry over up to 48 hours of unused paid sick leave to the following year; however, employers can limit the amount of leave an employee may take in any year to 48 hours.\nPaid Sick Leave at Separation\nThe HFWA does not create an obligation for employers to pay out unused, accrued paid sick leave at separation, regardless of the reason for separation.\nHowever, an individual may recover paid sick leave as a remedy for a retaliatory personnel action that prevented the individual from using paid sick leave.\nAdditionally, if an employer rehires a separated employee within six months of that employee’s separation, the employer must reinstate any unused, accrued paid sick leave the employee had during the employee’s previous employment.\nPaid Sick Leave and Public Health Emergencies (e.g., COVID-19)\nIn addition to the paid sick leave accrued as described above, employees are entitled to a one-time grant of leave in the event of a “public health emergency.”\nA public health emergency is defined as an act of bioterrorism, a pandemic influenza, or an epidemic caused by a novel and highly fatal infectious act, for which: (1) a disaster emergency is declared by the governor; or (2) an emergency is declared by a federal, state, or local public health agency; or (3) a highly infectious illness or agent with epidemic or pandemic potential for which a disaster emergency is declared by the governor.\nTo ensure employees may take paid sick leave for the reasons below, employers must supplement employees’ accrued paid sick leave as necessary (at least 80 hours for employees who work at least 40 hours a week; for employees who work fewer than 40 hours a week, the amount of time the employee is scheduled to work or the average of what the employee actually works in a 14-day period, whichever is greater):\nAn employee’s need to:\n(i) Self-isolate and care for oneself because the employee is diagnosed with a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(ii) Self-isolate and care for oneself because the employee is experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(iii) Seek or obtain medical diagnosis, care, or treatment if experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(iv) Seek preventive care concerning a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; or\n(v) Care for a family member who:\n(a) Is self-isolating after being diagnosed with a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(b) Is self-isolating due to experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\n(c) Needs medical diagnosis, care, or treatment if experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; or\n(d) Is seeking preventive care concerning a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;\nOr if:\n(i) A local, state, or federal public official or health authority having jurisdiction over the location in which the employee’s place of employment is located or the employee’s employer determines that the employee’s presence on the job or in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the employee’s exposure to the communicable illness or because the employee is exhibiting symptoms of the communicable illness, regardless of whether the employee has been diagnosed with the communicable illness;\nOr to:\n(ii) Care for a family member after a local, state, or federal public official or health authority having jurisdiction over the location in which the family member’s place of employment is located or the family member’s employer determines that the family member’s presence on the job or in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the family member’s exposure to the communicable illness or because the family member is exhibiting symptoms of the communicable illness, regardless of whether the family member has been diagnosed with the communicable illness;\n(iii) Care for a child or other family member when the individual’s child care provider is unavailable due to a public health emergency, or if the child’s or family member’s school or place of care has been closed by a local, state, or federal public official or at the discretion of the school or place of care due to a public health emergency, including if a school or place of care is physically closed but providing instruction remotely;\nOr due to:\n(iv) An employee’s inability to work because the employee has a health condition that may increase susceptibility to or risk of a communicable illness that is the cause of the public health emergency.\nEmployers may count an employee’s unused, accrued paid time off toward this supplemental leave. Employers may not require documentation for taking this leave and employees may use this leave up until four weeks after the official termination or suspension of the public health emergency.\nRecordkeeping\nEmployers must retain records for each employee for a two-year period, documenting hours worked, paid sick leave accrued, and paid sick leave used.\nAnti-Retaliation\nThe HFWA prohibits retaliation against employees who take this leave, providing an avenue of relief if employees feel their employer has taken any adverse action against them.\nViolations of the HFWA includes compensating an employee until the employee is reinstated or, if reinstatement is not feasible, for a reasonable period.\nAn employer who willfully retaliates against an employee will be subject to a civil fine of up to $100 for each separate violation.\nAggrieved individuals also may file a civil action after submitting a complaint to the Division or after making a written demand for compensation or other relief to the employer. An employer has 14 days to respond after receiving a notice from the Division that a complaint has been filed with it or a written demand from the aggrieved person.\nNotice to Employees\nEmployers must notify its employees, in writing, that they are entitled to paid sick leave, in accordance with the rules that will be promulgated by the Division. Employers must immediately post the Colorado Workplace Public Health Rights Poster and distribute to employees the Division’s Interpretive Notice & Formal Opinion #6A. Employers also must provide notices and posters in any language that is the first language spoken by at least five percent of its workforce.\nAdditional posters and notices will be made available to employers to comply with these notice requirements for 2021.\nColorado Health Emergency Leave with Pay (HELP) Rules Terminated\nColorado’s HELP Rules are no longer in effect. The HELP Rules were adopted and effective on March 11, 2020, and were to remain in effect for 30 days or the duration of the state of disaster emergency declared by the Governor up 120 days, whichever is greater. The Division terminated the requirements of the HELP Rules on July 14, the day before the HFWA went into effect.\nThe HELP Rules required employers to provide up to two weeks (up to a maximum of 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds of the employee’s regular rate of pay to employees with flu-like or respiratory illness symptoms who are being tested for COVID-19 or who are under instruction from a healthcare provider or authorized government official to quarantine or isolate due to a risk of having COVID-19.\n***\nJackson Lewis attorneys are available to assist employers in their compliance efforts.

The Division terminated the requirements of the HELP Rules on July 14, the day before the HFWA went into effect.\n\n### Recent Employment Law Updates in Colorado (2023-2024)  \nIn addition to the HFWA, Colorado has enacted several new employment laws and amendments relevant to small businesses that impact workplace policies and compliance:  \n\n- **2024 Amendments to the HFWA:** The HFWA has been expanded to include additional permissible reasons for leave, such as leave related to reproductive health care and organ or bone marrow donation, further broadening employee protections. Employers should review and update their paid sick leave policies accordingly.  \n\n- **Job Application Fairness Act (JAFA):** Effective in 2023, JAFA prohibits employers from asking applicants about their age or date of birth on initial job applications, aiming to reduce age discrimination in hiring. Employers should revise application forms to comply.  \n\n- **Colorado Equal Pay for Equal Work Act (EPEWA) Amendments:** New disclosure and notice requirements have been added, including providing pay range information to applicants and employees, and posting updated notices about employee rights. Employers must update hiring and compensation practices to meet these requirements.  \n\n- **Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) Act:** Starting in 2024, Colorado’s FAMLI program provides paid family and medical leave insurance benefits to eligible employees. Employers are required to contribute to the program and provide notice to employees. Small businesses should prepare for administrative and payroll changes.  \n\n- **Noncompete Statute Changes:** Amendments have enhanced enforcement mechanisms and increased penalties for violations of noncompete agreements, emphasizing the need for employers to carefully draft and enforce such agreements in compliance with state law.  \n\n- **CROWN Act Amendments:** Colorado has expanded protections against discrimination based on hair texture and protective hairstyles, including prohibiting discrimination based on hair length, reinforcing inclusive workplace policies.  \n\n- **Colorado Disability Opportunity Office (CDOO):** Established to promote employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities, the CDOO offers resources and support that employers can leverage to enhance workplace inclusion.  \n\n- **Biometric Data Privacy Requirements:** Effective July 2025, new laws will regulate the collection, use, and storage of biometric data, requiring employers to implement policies protecting employee biometric information. Employers should begin preparing compliance strategies.  \n\n### Practical Compliance Tips for Small Businesses  \nSmall businesses should:  \n- Regularly review and update employee handbooks and policies to incorporate HFWA amendments and other new laws.  \n- Ensure job application forms and hiring practices comply with JAFA and EPEWA requirements.  \n- Prepare for FAMLI program participation by understanding contribution obligations and employee notifications.  \n- Consult legal counsel to review noncompete agreements and ensure enforceability under updated statutes.  \n- Update anti-discrimination policies to reflect CROWN Act protections.  \n- Develop data privacy policies addressing biometric information ahead of the 2025 effective date.  \n\nJackson Lewis attorneys remain available to assist employers with compliance strategies, policy updates, employee handbook revisions, and navigating these evolving employment laws in Colorado. Employers are encouraged to seek legal guidance to ensure full compliance and mitigate risks.  \n\n### Employee Handbook Templates and Guidance  \nTo assist employers in complying with the HFWA, many resources are available for employee handbook templates that include paid sick leave policies consistent with the Act. Employers can purchase or download these templates from reputable legal and HR service providers, including Jackson Lewis, SHRM, Business-in-a-Box, Nolo’s Create Your Own Employee Handbook, HR Enterprise, and other specialized vendors. These templates typically range from basic policy outlines to comprehensive handbooks covering multiple workplace laws and regulations. Pricing models vary and may include one-time purchases or subscription-based access, depending on the provider.\n\nFor example, SHRM offers an Employee Handbook Builder through a subscription model that provides customizable templates, regular updates, and compliance alerts, helping employers tailor policies to meet HFWA requirements. Business-in-a-Box provides an extensive library of over 1,800 business and legal templates, including employee handbooks, available for a one-time purchase or subscription, with options to customize content to reflect HFWA provisions. Nolo’s Create Your Own Employee Handbook combines a legal guide with a fill-in-the-blank template, enabling employers to develop compliant handbooks with clear instructions on incorporating paid sick leave policies. HR Enterprise offers a customizable employee handbook template with pricing based on the number of employees, designed to help employers maintain compliance with state laws such as the HFWA.\n\nWhen selecting or customizing an employee handbook, employers should ensure the paid sick leave provisions align with HFWA requirements, including accrual rates, permissible uses of leave, notice procedures, and anti-retaliation protections. Many templates offer customization options to tailor policies to company-specific practices, workforce languages, and operational needs. It is important that employers carefully review and update handbook language regularly to incorporate any changes to the HFWA or related regulations, ensuring ongoing compliance.\n\nJackson Lewis attorneys are available to assist employers in their compliance efforts, including revisions to language in employee handbooks, implementation strategies, and other workplace issues. If you have questions about the HFWA, including the poster and employee notice requirements, or need guidance on selecting, customizing, or purchasing employee handbook templates, please contact the Jackson Lewis attorney with whom you regularly work.  \n\n### Colorado Labor Law Posters: Requirements and Resources  \nIn addition to employee notices required under the HFWA, Colorado employers must display mandatory labor law posters in the workplace. These posters inform employees of their rights under various state and federal labor laws, including the HFWA, wage and hour laws, anti-discrimination statutes, and workplace safety regulations. Employers are required to post these notices in conspicuous locations where employees can easily see them, such as break rooms, common areas, or near time clocks.\n\nEmployers can obtain official Colorado labor law posters from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) website, which provides free downloadable and printable versions of required posters. Additionally, commercial vendors offer laminated or digital versions of these posters for purchase, often bundled with federal labor law posters to ensure comprehensive compliance. Popular vendors include LaborLawCenter, PosterCompliance, and CompliancePoster, which provide updated posters reflecting the latest legal changes, including HFWA provisions. Pricing for commercial posters varies depending on format and vendor, with options for one-time purchases or subscription services that include automatic updates.\n\nFor employers with remote or hybrid workforces, digital posters or electronic distribution of notices may be necessary to meet posting requirements. Employers should ensure that remote employees receive all required notices in a timely and accessible manner, either electronically or by mail, to maintain compliance.\n\nFailure to post required labor law posters can result in penalties and increased risk of enforcement actions by state or federal agencies. Therefore, employers should regularly verify that posters are current, properly displayed, and accessible to all employees. Updates to posters occur periodically to reflect changes in laws such as the HFWA, so subscribing to update services or regularly checking official sources is recommended.\n\nJackson Lewis attorneys can assist employers in understanding poster requirements, obtaining compliant posters, and integrating posting obligations with overall HFWA and employment law compliance strategies.  \n\n### Leave Management Software for HFWA Compliance  \nEmployers seeking to manage compliance with Colorado’s paid sick leave laws, including the HFWA, can benefit from specialized leave management software designed to automate tracking, accrual, usage, and reporting of paid sick leave. Leading software solutions such as AbsenceSoft, Paychex, and others offer platforms that integrate Colorado-specific paid sick leave rules, including accrual rates, permissible leave reasons, and carryover limits. These tools help employers streamline leave requests, maintain accurate records, generate compliance reports, and reduce administrative burden.\n\nKey features to consider include automated accrual calculations, employee self-service portals, integration with payroll systems, alerts for policy updates, and support for multi-state compliance. Utilizing such software can enhance accuracy, ensure timely compliance with HFWA requirements, and mitigate risks of violations or penalties. Employers are encouraged to evaluate software options based on their company size, industry, and specific compliance needs, and to consult legal counsel for guidance on integrating technology solutions with their overall compliance strategy.\n\n### Colorado Secretary of State’s Role in Business Compliance  \nIn addition to employment law compliance, Colorado employers should be aware of the Colorado Secretary of State’s office, which plays a critical role in business legislation and compliance. The Secretary of State oversees business registration, filing requirements, periodic reports, trade name filings, and other essential business compliance functions. Employers must ensure timely filings and maintain good standing by submitting required annual or periodic reports and updating business information as necessary.\n\nThe business registration process includes filing formation documents for entities such as corporations, limited liability companies (LLCs), and partnerships through the Secretary of State’s online portal. This portal (https://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/BusinessEntityCriteria.do) allows for efficient submission of initial filings, amendments, dissolutions, and reinstatements. Businesses can also register trade names (\"doing business as\" names) and renew these registrations online to maintain exclusivity and compliance.\n\nTo help businesses stay current, the Secretary of State offers subscription-based email notifications that remind businesses of upcoming filing deadlines, renewal requirements, and other compliance obligations. These reminders are crucial to avoid delinquency, penalties, or administrative dissolution.\n\nAnnual and periodic report filings are mandatory for most business entities and must be submitted timely to maintain good standing. Failure to file these reports can result in late fees, loss of good standing, or administrative dissolution. The Secretary of State’s website provides detailed instructions and forms for these filings (https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/annualReports.html).\n\nAdditionally, the Secretary of State’s office provides resources related to trademarks and copyrights, including registration guidance and links to federal resources, helping businesses protect their intellectual property.\n\nEmployers should integrate Secretary of State compliance with their employment law obligations, such as the HFWA, to ensure comprehensive legal adherence.
