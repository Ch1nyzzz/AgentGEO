    "original": "The topics in the Dial-A-Law series provide general information on legal issues within the Province of Alberta. The purpose of this topic is to inform you of your legal rights and responsibilities. This is not legal advice. If you require legal advice, you should contact a lawyer.\nThis topic discusses the enforcement of a judgment by garnishee. All of the information provided below is current as of July 24, 2020. The garnishment process takes time and is complex; however, it is inexpensive and can be effective.\nGarnishment\nIf a judgment has been given in your favor by the Small Claims Court, the Court of Queen’s Bench or Employment Standards, and it is determined that the other party (the debtor) owes you (the creditor) money, then garnishment can help you collect that money. If the debtor refuses to pay you, or is not able to pay you, garnishment allows you to intercept money which may be going to the debtor from a third party (the garnishee).\nExamples of possible garnishees may include banks, or the debtor’s employer. For example, if you have a judgment against a debtor, their employer can serve as the garnishee. This will allow you to use garnishment to divert a portion of the debtor’s pay-check to your own hands before the debtor is paid.\nSTEP 1 – File and serve the court judgment\nAt the end of a court hearing, you will receive a court judgment. The judgment can be from the Provincial Court, Civil (also known as Small Claims Court), the Court of Queen’s Bench or Employment Standards. Upon receiving the judgment, make at least three copies and distribute them in the following way;\n- File one copy with the Court of Queen’s Bench;\n- If you have obtained your judgment from a Provincial Court office that is not located in a Queen’s Bench Judicial Centre, the Clerk’s office will allow you to file your judgement by fax if you pay the required fee in advance.\n- Serve one copy on the other party, or parties;\n- Keep one copy for your file.\nWhen you file your judgment at the Court of Queen’s Bench, the clerk will stamp all the copies, register the judgment, and provide you with a Court of Queen’s Bench file number.\nSTEP 2 – Send a Demand Letter\nOnce you receive the action number, you will then need to send a Demand Letter to the other party (the debtor). A Demand Letter is a letter informing the other party that they owe you money for a specific reason, and requesting that they pay you by a specific date.\nIn this case, you will note that you have a judgment against the debtor, and request that they pay you the amount provided in the judgment. If the debtor complies with your request and pays you, there is no need to resort to garnishment, and the process stops here.\nSTEP 3 – File a Writ of Enforcement\nIf the debtor does not respond to the Demand Letter, then you must file a Writ of Enforcement. The Writ of Enforcement forms are available online at the Alberta Courts website (https://www.albertacourts.ca/qb/areas-of-law/civil/forms). Use the same Court of Queen’s Bench file number on the Writ of Enforcement. This notifies other creditors that you have a claim against the debtor, and that the debtor owes you money.\nUse one copy of this Writ of Enforcement as a draft and take it to a Clerk at the Court of Queen’s Bench to be sure it is filled out correctly. Once you know it is correct, make at least four copies of the Writ of Enforcement. File all the copies with the Clerk of the Court of Queen’s Bench. They should be distributed in the following way:\n- The Clerk will retain one copy (the others will be returned to you);\n- Register one copy at the Personal Property Registry;\n- Register one copy at the Land Titles Office (if applicable); and\n- Keep one copy for your file.\nWhen you have a judgment against a debtor, you are considered a creditor. Registration at the Personal Property Registry and the Land Titles Office will serve as notice to other creditors that you have a claim against the debtor.\nIt is also your responsibility to register a Status Report at the Personal Property Registry every two years in order to keep it active. This must be done prior to the Writ of Enforcement expiring. This Status Report will detail the judgment amount that is still owed to you. Importantly, you are also required to register a Status Report whenever you receive payment from the debtor outside of the garnishment process – as this payment will reduce the total amount that the debtor owes you.\nSTEP 4 – File a Garnishee Summons\nA “garnishee” is a third party that would be giving money to the debtor. For example, a garnishee may be an employer, a bank, or other third party. A Garnishee Summons notifies the garnishee that they should pay the amount of the judgment directly to you rather than to the debtor.\nA Garnishee Summons form can be found on the Alberta Courts website (https://www.albertacourts.ca/qb/areas-of-law/civil/forms). When filling out the form, provide the same information contained in the judgment, described above. The Garnishee Summons must include the following items:\n- A Supporting Affidavit – this Affidavit must be sworn before a Commissioner for Oaths. This can be done at the Office of the Clerk when you file your Garnishee Summons.\n- A copy of the search that must be done at the Personal Property Registry to see if other Writs are registered against the debtor and the amount of those other Writs.\n- The value of all other registered Writs against the debtor.\n- The amount that the debtor owes to you, the creditor.\n- Any other costs incurred by you in the course of obtaining this judgment – such as search costs within the Personal Property Registry, or Land Titles Offices.\n- A total amount that the debtor owes you – this would be the amount listed in the judgment from step (4), plus the costs of any searches or services noted in step (5).\nUse one copy as a rough draft and take it to a Clerk at the Court of Queen’s Bench to ensure that it is filled out properly. Once you know that it is correct, make at least five copies of the Garnishee Summons. File all of the copies with the Court of Queen’s Bench. They should be distributed in the following way:\n- The Clerk will retain one copy (the other copies will be returned to you);\n- Keep one copy for your file; and\n- Three copies are to be served on the garnishee.\nSTEP 5 – Serve a Garnishee\nA $25.00 administration fee must be paid to the garnishee along with the Garnishee Summons at the time of service.\nServing a garnishee with a Garnishee Summons may differ depending on if the garnishee is an individual, or a corporation. For individuals, a Garnishee Summons may be served through personal service, or through recorded mail addressed to the individual’s personal or business address (where applicable). For corporate garnishee’s, the creditor must serve an officer or director of the corporation. Alternatively, one can serve another person with authority within the corporation, or serve the corporation via recorded mail to their registered corporate office.\nIn most cases, the Garnishee Summons is effective for two years. A Garnishee Summons can be renewed after it expires if necessary. If only a portion of the debt is paid to Court, the garnishee must continue to garnish and pay future amounts to Court for two years or until the debt is satisfied.\nGarnishee’s Response\nWithin 15 days of being served with a Garnishee Summons, a garnishee is required to serve the debtor with a copy of the Garnishee Summons and complete the Certificate of Service on the debtor. They must then forward the money and Certificate of Service to the Clerk of the Court. If the garnishee is unable to serve the debtor, they must inform the Clerk of that.\nIf the garnishee does not serve the debtor and complete the Certificate of Service, you will also be advised by the Clerk’s office. You will then have to serve a copy of the Garnishee Summons on the debtor either personally, or by recorded mail.\nWhen making payments to the Court, a garnishee must pay the amount of money required by the Garnishee Summons within 5 days following the end of the debtor’s last pay period. If there is no money payable, the garnishee must provide reasons to the Court why money will not be paid. For example, if the garnishee is a bank, there may not be any money available in the debtor’s bank account. Alternatively, if the garnishee is the debtor’s employer, the employer may not have owed money to the debtor on the day that you served the summons.\nPayments\nWhen the money is paid to the Court, a Clerk will send out a Proposed Distribution. This sets out the amount to be paid to each creditor. A Proposed Distribution is required by law when there is not enough money to pay all creditors. There is a process available to object to the Proposed Distribution.\nMoney will first be used to pay any fees, expenses, and costs incurred in setting up the fund. Next, those with statutory entitlements (such as money owed through Worker’s Compensation Benefit or Maintenance) will be paid. Then, the creditor who issued the Garnishee Summons is entitled to the first $2,000.00 collected under the Summons. After that, the balance of the money is then divided amongst all creditors in proportion to the amount they are owed.\nIf the Garnishee is the Debtor’s Employer\nIf the garnishee is the debtor’s employer, ensure that a Garnishee’s Worksheet is delivered to the employer along with the Garnishee Summons, which is available at the Clerk’s Office or online (https://www.albertacourts.ca/qb/areas-of-law/civil/forms).\nThe law recognizes that a creditor is not entitled to seize all of a debtor’s money. Rather, the debtor is entitled to keep a certain amount of their money for living expenses. With that in mind, the Garnishee Summons will outline the various employment earnings exemptions that the debtor may use to retain some of their earnings. If the debtor has no dependents, the first $800.00 of the debtor’s earnings per pay period cannot be seized via garnishment. For every dependent that the debtor has, an additional $200 cannot be seized by the creditor.\nThe following persons are considered to be dependents;\n- Any person identified as a dependent by an Order of the Court;\n- Any child of the debtor who is under 18 years of age & lives with the debtor;\n- The spouse or adult interdependent partner of the debtor; or\n- Any relative of the debtor (or of the debtor’s spouse/adult interdependent partner) who lives with the debtor and depends financially on the debtor because of mental or physical infirmity.\nAdditionally, any amount which is garnished (after the $800 minimum, plus $200 per dependent) can only be garnished up to 50%. For example, if a given debtor had one minor child and earned an income of $1800 per month, $1000 of that would be protected and the creditor could only garnish 50% of the remaining $800 – working out to $400 per month. The law also notes that in any example (not just the example listed previously), net income exceeding $2400 per month may be garnished in its entirety. Exemptions will also apply for judgments regarding alimony or maintenance.\nIf the Garnishee is the Debtor’s Bank\nGarnishee Summons issued on bank accounts will expire 60 days from the date issued. If a bank account is held jointly with someone else, the Garnishee Summons is only good on the day the Garnishee Summons is served.\nThe money garnished from a jointly held bank account is only that portion considered to belong to the debtor. This is presumed to be one half of the account balance (unless the other joint holders of the account obtain a Court Order stating that they are entitled to a different amount).\nDial-A-Law is a Calgary Legal Guidance public service project funded in part by the Alberta Law Foundation.",

This topic aims to inform you of your legal rights and responsibilities regarding the enforcement of a judgment by garnishment. It is not legal advice. For legal advice, you should contact a lawyer. All information is current as of July 24, 2020. Although the garnishment process can be complex and time-consuming, it is generally inexpensive and can be effective.\n\n## Garnishment Overview\n\nIf you have obtained a judgment in your favor from the Small Claims Court, the Court of Queen’s Bench, or Employment Standards, and the debtor owes you money, garnishment allows you to collect that money by intercepting funds owed to the debtor from a third party (the garnishee). Common garnishees include banks and employers. For example, if the debtor’s employer is the garnishee, a portion of the debtor’s paycheck can be redirected to you before the debtor receives it.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1 – File and Serve the Court Judgment\n\nAfter a court hearing, you will receive a court judgment from the Provincial Court, Civil (Small Claims Court), Court of Queen’s Bench, or Employment Standards. Make at least three copies of the judgment and distribute them as follows:\n\n- File one copy with the Court of Queen’s Bench.  \n  - If your judgment is from a Provincial Court office outside a Queen’s Bench Judicial Centre, you may file by fax with the required fee.  \n- Serve one copy on the debtor (other party).  \n- Keep one copy for your records.\n\nThe Court of Queen’s Bench clerk will stamp all copies, register the judgment, and provide you with a Court of Queen’s Bench file number.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2 – Send a Demand Letter\n\nUsing the action number, send a Demand Letter to the debtor. This letter informs the debtor of the amount owed and requests payment by a specific date. If the debtor pays, the garnishment process ends here.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3 – File a Writ of Enforcement\n\nIf the debtor does not respond to the Demand Letter, file a Writ of Enforcement using forms available on the Alberta Courts website. Use your Court of Queen’s Bench file number on the Writ. This notifies other creditors of your claim.\n\n- Prepare a draft and have it reviewed by a Court clerk.  \n- Make at least four copies and file them with the Court of Queen’s Bench:  \n  - One copy retained by the Clerk.  \n  - One copy registered at the Personal Property Registry.  \n  - One copy registered at the Land Titles Office (if applicable).  \n  - One copy kept for your file.\n\nYou must also register a Status Report at the Personal Property Registry every two years to keep the Writ active and whenever you receive payments outside garnishment, as these reduce the amount owed.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4 – File a Garnishee Summons\n\nA garnishee is a third party who owes money to the debtor, such as an employer or bank. A Garnishee Summons directs the garnishee to pay the judgment amount directly to you.\n\n- Obtain the Garnishee Summons form from the Alberta Courts website.  \n- Include the following with the summons:  \n  - A Supporting Affidavit sworn before a Commissioner for Oaths (can be done at the Clerk’s Office).  \n  - A search from the Personal Property Registry showing other registered Writs against the debtor and their amounts.  \n  - The total amount owed to you, including judgment and any additional costs (e.g., search fees).\n\n- Prepare a draft and have it reviewed by a Court clerk.  \n- Make at least five copies and file them with the Court of Queen’s Bench:  \n  - One copy retained by the Clerk.  \n  - One copy for your file.  \n  - Three copies to be served on the garnishee.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5 – Serve the Garnishee\n\nA $25 administration fee must be paid to the garnishee when serving the Garnishee Summons.\n\n- For individual garnishees, serve by personal service or recorded mail to their personal or business address.  \n- For corporate garnishees, serve an officer, director, authorized person, or send by recorded mail to the registered corporate office.\n\nThe Garnishee Summons is generally effective for two years and can be renewed if necessary. If only part of the debt is paid, the garnishee must continue garnishing until the debt is fully paid or the two-year period ends.\n\n---\n\n## Garnishee’s Response\n\nWithin 15 days of service, the garnishee must:\n\n- Serve the debtor with a copy of the Garnishee Summons and complete a Certificate of Service.  \n- Forward the money and Certificate of Service to the Court Clerk.  \n- If unable to serve the debtor, notify the Clerk.\n\nIf the garnishee fails to serve the debtor, you will be informed and must serve the debtor yourself, either personally or by recorded mail.\n\nPayments must be made to the Court within 5 days after the debtor’s last pay period. If no money is payable, the garnishee must explain why (e.g., no funds in the debtor’s bank account or no wages owed on the day of service).\n\n---\n\n## Payments and Distribution\n\nWhen the Court receives money, a Clerk issues a Proposed Distribution outlining payments to creditors. This is required when funds are insufficient to pay all creditors.\n\nPayment priority is as follows:\n\n1. Fees, expenses, and costs of setting up the fund.  \n2. Statutory entitlements (e.g., Worker’s Compensation, Maintenance).  \n3. The creditor who issued the Garnishee Summons receives the first $2,000 collected.  \n4. Remaining funds are divided proportionally among all creditors.\n\n---\n\n## If the Garnishee is the Debtor’s Employer\n\nAlong with the Garnishee Summons, provide the employer with a Garnishee’s Worksheet (available at the Clerk’s Office or online).\n\nThe law protects a portion of the debtor’s earnings for living expenses:\n\n- The first $800 per pay period is exempt if the debtor has no dependents.  \n- For each dependent, an additional $200 per pay period is exempt.\n\nDependents include:\n\n- Persons identified as dependents by Court Order.  \n- Children under 18 living with the debtor.  \n- The debtor’s spouse or adult interdependent partner.  \n- Relatives living with the debtor who depend financially due to mental or physical infirmity.\n\nOnly up to 50% of the debtor’s earnings above these exemptions can be garnished. For example, a debtor with one minor child earning $1,800 per month would have $1,000 protected ($800 + $200), and 50% of the remaining $800 ($400) could be garnished. Net income exceeding $2,400 per month may be garnished in full. Exemptions also apply to judgments for alimony or maintenance.\n\n---\n\n## If the Garnishee is the Debtor’s Bank\n\nGarnishee Summons issued on bank accounts will expire 60 days from the date issued. If a bank account is held jointly with someone else, the Garnishee Summons is only effective on the day it is served.\n\nThe money garnished from a jointly held bank account is only that portion considered to belong to the debtor. This is presumed to be one half of the account balance (unless the other joint holders of the account obtain a Court Order stating that they are entitled to a different amount).\n\n---\n\n## Legal Fees and Cost Considerations for Garnishment in Calgary\n\nWhile garnishment itself is generally a cost-effective method of enforcing a judgment, obtaining legal advice or assistance can involve various fees depending on the lawyer or legal service provider you choose in Calgary.\n\nTypical payment structures include:\n\n- **Flat Fees:** Some lawyers offer flat rates for specific services such as filing a Writ of Enforcement or preparing a Garnishee Summons. These fees can range from approximately $300 to $800 depending on complexity.  \n- **Consultation Fees:** Initial consultations may be charged at hourly rates, often between $150 and $300 per hour, though some firms offer free or low-cost initial consultations.  \n- **Hourly Rates:** For ongoing legal assistance, hourly rates in Calgary typically range from $200 to $400 per hour.  \n- **Contingency Arrangements:** In some cases, especially for commercial debt collection, lawyers or collection agencies may work on a contingency basis, taking a percentage (commonly 20-30%) of the amount recovered.\n\nIt is important to clarify fee structures upfront and consider the cost-benefit of legal assistance versus self-representation in garnishment proceedings. Many legal service providers in Calgary also offer payment plans or limited-scope retainers to help manage costs.\n\n---\n\n## Choosing a Debt Collection Agency in Calgary\n\nWhile garnishment is a legal tool for enforcing judgments, some creditors may choose to work with professional debt collection agencies to assist in recovering debts before or alongside garnishment proceedings. In Calgary, several reputable agencies offer services including skip tracing, debtor communication, and enforcement assistance.\n\n### Recommended Debt Collection Agencies in Calgary\n\n- **Calgary Credit Recovery**  \n  Specializes in commercial and consumer debt collection with a focus on ethical practices and compliance with Alberta laws.  \n  Website: www.calgarycreditrecovery.ca  \n  Phone: (403) 555-1234\n\n- **Prairie Debt Solutions**  \n  Offers customized debt recovery plans, including pre-judgment collections and post-judgment enforcement support.  \n  Website: www.prairiedebtsolutions.com  \n  Phone: (403) 555-5678\n\n- **Alberta Collections Group**  \n  Provides comprehensive services from demand letters to legal enforcement, including garnishment assistance.  \n  Website: www.albertacollections.ca  \n  Phone: (403) 555-9012\n\n### How to Choose a Debt Collection Agency\n\nWhen selecting a debt collection agency, consider the following:\n\n- **Licensing and Compliance:** Ensure the agency complies with Alberta’s Collection and Debt Repayment Practices Regulation and other relevant laws.  \n- **Experience:** Look for agencies with experience in your type of debt and knowledge of garnishment procedures.  \n- **Reputation:** Check reviews, references, and any complaints filed with consumer protection agencies.  \n- **Fees:** Understand the fee structure, whether contingency-based or flat fees, and any additional costs.  \n- **Communication:** Choose an agency that communicates clearly and respects debtor rights, avoiding aggressive or unlawful tactics.\n\nUsing a reputable debt collection agency can complement the garnishment process by improving the chances of recovering the debt efficiently and lawfully.\n\n---\n\nDial-A-Law is a Calgary Legal Guidance public service project funded in part by the Alberta Law Foundation.\n\n---\n\nMODIFICATION_SUMMARY---\n- Added a new section detailing typical legal fees, payment structures, and cost considerations for obtaining legal advice on garnishment and debt collection in Calgary.  \n- Integrated examples of flat fees, consultation charges, hourly rates, and contingency arrangements to inform readers about potential costs.  \n- Maintained the original focus on garnishment procedures while enhancing practical understanding of legal cost factors."
