--- Processing Query: instagram influencer top accounts ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document is a comprehensive, scholarly article focused on the theoretical and empirical process of how social media influencers acquire celebrity capital, termed 'influencer celebrification.' It is dense, academic, and heavily focused on conceptual frameworks, qualitative methodology, and nuanced distinctions between traditional celebrities and influencers. The query 'instagram influencer top accounts' is more transactional and practical, likely seeking lists, rankings, or straightforward data about top Instagram influencers. The target content lacks direct, simple lists or rankings of top Instagram influencer accounts, which are typically what such queries expect. Additionally, the tone and style are academic and theoretical rather than practical or list-based, which may cause retrieval or generative engines to overlook it for this query. The HTML structure is standard for academic articles and unlikely to cause extraction issues, but the content's focus and style mismatch the query intent. Therefore, the main reason for non-citation is the mismatch between the query's practical intent and the target's academic, conceptual content. To improve citation for such queries, the content could be restructured or supplemented with a clear, concise summary or section highlighting top Instagram influencers or practical influencer marketing insights relevant to Instagram specifically.
Tool Selected: content_restructure
📝 Key Changes: ['Reorganized the content into clear sections with headings for improved readability and extraction.', 'Condensed repetitive explanations and integrated examples to clarify key concepts like celebrity capital and influencer celebrification.', 'Summarized participant and influencer details into tables and concise descriptions to enhance clarity and relevance.']

--- Processing Query: reviews of digital influencer platforms ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document is a dense, academic article focused on the theoretical process of influencer celebrification and how social media influencers acquire celebrity capital. It lacks practical, transactional content such as direct reviews, comparisons, or rankings of digital influencer platforms, which is the core intent behind the query 'reviews of digital influencer platforms.' The tone is scholarly and conceptual rather than practical or consumer-oriented. The HTML/Markdown structure is standard and not a barrier to extraction. The main reason for non-citation is the content mismatch with the query intent: the target does not provide platform reviews or marketplace evaluations that users seeking 'reviews of digital influencer platforms' expect. To improve citation for such queries, the content should be additively enhanced with a dedicated, clearly marked section summarizing and reviewing key digital influencer platforms and marketplaces, including their features, pros, cons, and use cases. This addition should build on the existing academic framework without removing or contradicting prior modifications, thus preserving the article's integrity while increasing relevance for practical queries.
Tool Selected: knowledge_injection
📝 Key Changes: ['Added a dedicated section reviewing major digital influencer platforms and marketplaces, detailing their features, supported channels, pricing, pros and cons, and typical use cases.', 'Integrated the new section to complement the existing discussion on influencer celebrification by linking platform functionalities to the practices and roles identified in the study.', 'Maintained the article’s original structure, style, and focus while enhancing practical relevance for readers interested in influencer marketing tools.']
Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'reviews of digital influencer platforms' primarily because its core content is academic, theoretical, and focused on the sociocultural process of influencer celebrification rather than practical, transactional information about platform reviews. Although a dedicated section reviewing digital influencer platforms was added, the overall tone remains scholarly and the platform review section, while informative, is embedded within a dense academic article. This mismatch in user intent (seeking practical, comparative reviews) versus content style and focus reduces the likelihood of citation. The HTML/Markdown structure is standard and not a barrier. To improve citation, the content should be enhanced by making the platform review section more prominent, clearly marked, and possibly expanded with more practical, user-centric details such as direct comparisons, pros and cons, pricing transparency, and use cases. This would better align with the query intent without undoing previous modifications.
Tool Selected: knowledge_injection
📝 Key Changes: ['Added a featured sidebar at the start summarizing digital influencer platforms with user-centric insights on ease of use, support, integration, and pricing to enhance practical relevance.', "Expanded the existing 'Digital Influencer Platforms and Marketplaces' section with detailed, practical comparisons of platform features, pricing models, pros and cons, and typical use cases.", 'Included a concise bullet-pointed summary table addressing common user questions about platform selection and effectiveness, linking platform functionalities to influencer celebrification practices.']
Iteration 3/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'reviews of digital influencer platforms' primarily because, despite having a dedicated section reviewing digital influencer platforms, the overall tone remains highly academic and conceptual. The platform review content is embedded within a dense scholarly article focused on influencer celebrification theory, which mismatches the practical, transactional intent of the query. The review section, while detailed, is not sufficiently prominent or user-centric to be surfaced as a direct answer to practical queries seeking straightforward platform comparisons, pricing, pros/cons, and use cases. Additionally, the academic framing and style reduce the likelihood of the content being selected by generative engines for practical queries. The HTML/Markdown structure is standard and not a barrier. To fix this, the best approach is to restructure the platform review section to make it more accessible, clearly marked, and practically oriented, with a lead summary and bullet points that directly address common user questions. This restructuring will build upon previous knowledge injections and enhancements without undoing them, improving relevance and citation likelihood for practical queries.2025-12-31 23:32:14,717 - [INFO] - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

--- Processing Query: impact of social media on communication ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'impact of social media on communication' primarily because its core focus is on the sociocultural process of influencer celebrification and the acquisition of celebrity capital by social media influencers. The content is highly specialized, academic, and centered on influencer marketing theory, platform reviews, and advertising practices rather than the broader, general topic of social media's impact on interpersonal communication patterns. It lacks direct discussion or empirical analysis of how social media affects communication styles, language, interpersonal dynamics, or societal communication changes, which are central to the query. The tone is scholarly and conceptual, not addressing the communication impact in a general or accessible manner. The HTML/Markdown structure is standard and not a barrier. To improve citation likelihood for this query, the content should be additively enhanced with a clearly marked, accessible section summarizing key findings or insights on how social media influences communication patterns, language use, or interpersonal interactions, drawing from relevant research or linking influencer celebrification to communication changes. This addition should build upon existing modifications without undoing them, preserving the article's integrity while increasing relevance for communication-focused queries.
Tool Selected: knowledge_injection
📝 Key Changes: ['Added a new section titled "The Broader Impact of Social Media on Interpersonal Communication" to address how social media alters communication patterns, language use, social interaction dynamics, and societal effects, linking these changes to influencer celebrification.', 'Integrated this new section into the discussion to bridge the theoretical focus on influencer celebrification with broader communication impacts relevant to user queries.', 'Ensured the new content complements and enriches existing sections without altering the article’s core focus or previously implemented structural and stylistic modifications.']
Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'impact of social media on communication' primarily because its core content is highly specialized and focused on the sociocultural process of influencer celebrification and celebrity capital acquisition. While it contains a newly added section addressing the broader impact of social media on interpersonal communication, this section remains embedded within a dense, academic article with a strong theoretical and marketing focus. The tone is scholarly and conceptual rather than accessible or directly addressing the general communication impact that typical queries on this topic expect. Additionally, the broader communication impact section, although present, is relatively brief and may not be prominent or clearly signposted enough to be surfaced by generative engines for this query. The HTML/Markdown structure is standard and not a barrier. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be additively enhanced by making the communication impact section more prominent, clearly marked, and expanded with accessible summaries, key findings, and practical insights on how social media affects communication patterns, language, and interpersonal dynamics. This enhancement should build upon existing modifications without undoing them, preserving the article's integrity while increasing relevance and visibility for communication-focused queries.
Tool Selected: content_restructure

Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'hootsuite social media fame tools' primarily because it focuses on the academic and theoretical process of influencer celebrification and celebrity capital acquisition, rather than providing practical, transactional, or tool-specific content about social media management or scheduling tools like Hootsuite. Although the document includes a detailed section reviewing digital influencer platforms and marketplaces, it does not specifically address or review social media scheduling and posting tools, nor does it mention Hootsuite or similar fame management tools in a practical context. The tone remains scholarly and conceptual, which mismatches the practical intent of the query. The HTML/Markdown structure is standard and not a barrier. To improve citation likelihood for this query, the best approach is to add a clearly marked, dedicated, and practically oriented section focused on social media scheduling and posting tools, including Hootsuite, with detailed features, use cases, pricing, pros and cons, and comparisons. This addition should build upon existing modifications without undoing them, enhancing practical relevance and visibility for queries about social media fame tools.2025-12-31 23:35:24,321 - [INFO] - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

📝 Key Changes: ['Added a dedicated section on social media scheduling and posting tools, including a detailed review of Hootsuite and other popular platforms, integrating practical details such as features, pricing, pros/cons, and typical use cases.', 'Linked the functionalities of scheduling tools like Hootsuite to the influencer celebrification process, emphasizing their role in supporting generative, collaborative, and evaluative practices.', 'Seamlessly incorporated this new section into the existing document without altering the article’s core focus or previously implemented structural and stylistic modifications.']
Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'hootsuite social media fame tools' because, despite having a newly added section on social media scheduling and posting tools including Hootsuite, the content remains embedded within a dense, academic article focused on influencer celebrification theory. The tone is scholarly and conceptual rather than practical and transactional, which mismatches the user intent seeking straightforward, tool-specific, and comparative information about Hootsuite and similar platforms. Additionally, the section on scheduling tools, while detailed, is not sufficiently prominent or clearly signposted to be surfaced as a direct answer. The HTML/Markdown structure is standard and not a barrier. To improve citation likelihood, the best approach is to restructure the social media scheduling and posting tools section to make it more accessible, clearly marked, and practically oriented, with a lead summary and bullet points that directly address common user questions about Hootsuite and comparable tools. This restructuring will build upon previous knowledge injections and enhancements without undoing them, improving relevance and citation likelihood for practical queries about social media fame tools.

Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'youtube influencer marketing trends' primarily because it is a dense, academic article focused on the theoretical process of influencer celebrification and celebrity capital acquisition. While it contains rich conceptual frameworks and detailed discussions on influencer marketing, it lacks direct, practical, and up-to-date content specifically about current YouTube influencer marketing trends, such as emerging content formats, platform-specific strategies, or actionable trend insights that typical users expect. The tone is scholarly and conceptual rather than practical and trend-focused. The document does include sections on digital influencer platforms and social media scheduling tools, but these are not explicitly tied to YouTube trends or the evolving influencer marketing landscape on YouTube. Additionally, the content is embedded within a comprehensive academic article, which reduces its visibility for practical, trend-oriented queries. To improve citation likelihood, the best approach is to add a clearly marked, accessible, and practically oriented section summarizing current YouTube influencer marketing trends, including data, examples, and actionable insights. This addition should build upon existing modifications without undoing them, preserving the article's integrity while increasing relevance and visibility for queries about YouTube influencer marketing trends.

Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'youtube influencer marketing trends' primarily because, despite having a newly added dedicated section on YouTube influencer marketing trends, the content remains embedded within a dense, academic article focused on influencer celebrification theory. The tone is scholarly and conceptual rather than practical and trend-focused, which mismatches the typical user intent seeking up-to-date, actionable insights and concise trend summaries. Additionally, the YouTube trends section, while comprehensive, is not sufficiently prominent or clearly signposted to be surfaced as a direct, practical answer by generative engines. The HTML/Markdown structure is standard and not a barrier. To improve citation likelihood, the best approach is to restructure and enhance the YouTube influencer marketing trends section to make it more accessible, clearly marked, and practically oriented, with a lead summary and bullet points that directly address common user questions about YouTube influencer marketing trends. This enhancement should build upon existing modifications without undoing them, preserving the article's integrity while increasing relevance and visibility for practical, trend-oriented queries.
