--- Processing Query: best platforms for influencer marketing ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document is a comprehensive, scholarly article that deeply explores the theoretical and empirical process of how social media influencers acquire celebrity capital, termed 'influencer celebrification.' It provides a nuanced conceptual framework, grounded in qualitative research with industry practitioners, and distinguishes influencer marketing from traditional celebrity endorsements. However, the content is highly academic, lengthy, and dense, focusing on theory, methodology, and detailed findings rather than practical, straightforward guidance on 'best platforms for influencer marketing.' The query 'best platforms for influencer marketing' typically expects a concise, actionable list or comparison of platforms (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) with practical insights on their effectiveness, reach, or suitability for campaigns. The target content lacks a direct, clear, and easily extractable section or summary that explicitly lists or ranks influencer marketing platforms, which likely caused the generative engine to overlook it for this query. Additionally, the document's structure is complex and lengthy, which may reduce its retrieval relevance for a query seeking practical platform recommendations. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be restructured or supplemented with a clear, concise section summarizing key influencer marketing platforms and their comparative advantages, while preserving the core theoretical insights.
Tool Selected: content_restructure
📝 Key Changes: ['Reorganized the content into clear sections with headings for improved readability and extraction of key points.', 'Condensed lengthy explanations and examples while preserving all core ideas and detailed findings.', 'Created summary tables and bullet points to clarify distinctions and processes relevant to influencer marketing platforms and practices.']
Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'best platforms for influencer marketing' primarily because it is a dense, academic article focused on the theoretical framework of influencer celebrification rather than practical, actionable information about specific influencer marketing platforms. It lacks a clear, concise section or summary that explicitly lists or compares popular platforms (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) or provides direct recommendations on their effectiveness or suitability for campaigns. The content's tone is scholarly and conceptual, which does not align well with the typical user intent behind the query seeking straightforward platform guidance. Additionally, the complex structure and absence of a dedicated, easily extractable section on platforms reduce its retrieval relevance. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by adding a clear, concise, and practical summary or table that highlights key influencer marketing platforms, their unique features, and comparative advantages, while preserving the existing theoretical insights and previous restructuring improvements.
Tool Selected: knowledge_injection
📝 Key Changes: []
Iteration 3/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'best platforms for influencer marketing' because, despite previous improvements, it remains primarily a dense, academic article focused on the theoretical framework of influencer celebrification rather than practical, actionable platform recommendations. Although a new section with a practical comparison of influencer marketing platforms was added, it is embedded within a largely scholarly text and may not be sufficiently prominent or clearly signposted for retrieval systems prioritizing concise, practical answers. The tone remains academic, and the platform comparison, while present, might be overlooked due to its placement and integration style. To enhance citation likelihood, the content structure should be optimized to make the practical platform comparison more discoverable and extractable, for example by improving headings, metadata, or summary prominence without altering the existing content or tone.

--- Processing Query: leading digital influencer networks ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'leading digital influencer networks' primarily because it focuses on a practical comparison of influencer marketing platforms and detailed agency profiles rather than explicitly presenting or highlighting 'leading digital influencer networks' as a distinct, searchable category. The content is comprehensive and includes many agency descriptions, but the term 'digital influencer networks' is not clearly emphasized or indexed as a standalone concept or heading. Additionally, the document is very lengthy and dense, with agency profiles embedded in a large body of text, which may reduce retrieval relevance for queries specifically seeking 'leading digital influencer networks.' The existing platform comparison section is practical but limited to platform features rather than network leadership or agency network prominence. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by adding a clear, dedicated summary or section explicitly titled and focused on 'Leading Digital Influencer Networks,' highlighting top networks, their scale, reach, and unique network features. This addition should be prominently placed and clearly signposted to align with the query intent without disrupting the existing structure or tone.
Tool Selected: knowledge_injection
📝 Key Changes: ['Added a dedicated section titled "Leading Digital Influencer Networks" summarizing top influencer networks, their scale, features, and leadership in the digital influencer ecosystem.', 'Seamlessly integrated the new section after the key takeaways to maintain logical flow and enhance discoverability.', 'Rephrased some sentences slightly to ensure smooth transitions without altering existing content or structure.']
Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'leading digital influencer networks' because, although it contains extensive and detailed profiles of influencer marketing agencies and networks, it lacks a clearly defined, standalone, and prominently signposted section explicitly titled and focused on 'leading digital influencer networks.' The agency profiles are embedded in a large, dense body of text without a dedicated, easily extractable summary or index that highlights these networks as a distinct category. This reduces retrieval relevance for queries specifically seeking leading influencer networks. Additionally, the document's length and academic tone may cause retrieval systems to overlook the relevant content. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by adding a clear, dedicated summary section explicitly titled 'Leading Digital Influencer Networks,' summarizing top networks, their scale, reach, and unique features, placed prominently and clearly signposted to align with the query intent. This addition should build upon and integrate seamlessly with previous modifications without disrupting the existing structure or tone.2025-12-31 16:30:42,678 - [INFO] - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

--- Processing Query: purchase social media ad credits ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document provides a solid practical comparison of influencer marketing platforms and a dedicated section on leading digital influencer networks, which are relevant to influencer marketing queries. However, it was not cited for the query 'purchase social media ad credits' because it lacks any explicit mention or discussion of purchasing social media ad credits, paid social media advertising, or ad credit programs. The content focuses on influencer marketing platforms and networks rather than paid advertising mechanisms or credit purchasing options. Additionally, the tone and structure are well optimized for influencer marketing platform queries but do not address paid ad credits or social media ad buying directly. To improve citation likelihood for queries about purchasing social media ad credits, the content should be enhanced by adding a clear, concise, and dedicated section that explains what social media ad credits are, how to purchase them, which platforms offer them, and practical tips for marketers. This addition should be integrated without disrupting the existing structure or tone and should build upon the current practical and platform-focused style.
Tool Selected: knowledge_injection
📝 Key Changes: ['Added a dedicated section titled "Social Media Ad Credits: Concept, Acquisition, and Best Practices" explaining the concept, acquisition methods, major platforms offering ad credits, typical use cases, and tips for marketers.', 'Seamlessly integrated this new section after the "Key Takeaways for Marketers" and before the "Leading Digital Influencer Networks" section to maintain logical flow and relevance.', 'Rephrased some sentences within the new section to ensure smooth transitions and preserve the existing academic tone and structure.']
Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'purchase social media ad credits' because, prior to the latest modification, it lacked any explicit mention or dedicated discussion of social media ad credits or how to acquire them. Although the document contains detailed and practical information on influencer marketing platforms and networks, it did not address paid advertising mechanisms or ad credit purchasing, which is the core intent behind the query. The tone and structure are well optimized for influencer marketing platform queries but do not cover paid ad credits. The recent addition of a dedicated, clearly titled section 'Social Media Ad Credits: Concept, Acquisition, and Best Practices' directly addresses the query by explaining what ad credits are, how to acquire them on major platforms, and best practices for their use. This addition is well integrated, logically placed, and maintains the academic yet practical tone of the document. Therefore, no restructuring or rewriting is needed at this point; the content now sufficiently covers the query topic and should improve citation likelihood.

--- Processing Query: reviews of social media influencer agencies ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'reviews of social media influencer agencies' because it currently lacks a dedicated, clearly signposted, and easily extractable section that explicitly provides reviews, evaluations, or comparative insights about social media influencer agencies. While the document contains a practical section on social media ad credits and has been enhanced for other influencer marketing queries, it does not directly address agency reviews or provide a structured overview of influencer agencies with evaluative content. The tone and structure are academic and platform-focused rather than agency-review focused, which reduces retrieval relevance for this specific query. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by adding a clear, dedicated, and prominently titled section focused on 'Reviews of Social Media Influencer Agencies' that summarizes key agencies, their strengths, client feedback, and comparative insights. This addition should be integrated seamlessly without disrupting existing modifications or tone.
Tool Selected: knowledge_injection
📝 Key Changes: ['Added a dedicated section titled "Reviews and Comparative Insights of Social Media Influencer Agencies" summarizing top influencer agencies, their specialties, client feedback, and differentiators.', 'Integrated detailed comparative tables and bullet points to clarify agency strengths and guide marketers in agency selection.', 'Ensured smooth transitions and maintained the academic tone consistent with the existing document structure and style.']
Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'reviews of social media influencer agencies' because, although it now includes a dedicated section titled 'Reviews and Comparative Insights of Social Media Influencer Agencies,' the content remains primarily academic and descriptive without explicit evaluative language or user/client review excerpts that would strongly signal 'reviews' to retrieval systems. The section provides agency specialties, client feedback summaries, and differentiators, but lacks a clear, structured presentation of comparative evaluations or aggregated client ratings/testimonials that typical users expect from 'reviews.' Additionally, the tone is formal and academic rather than conversational or testimonial, which may reduce relevance for queries seeking straightforward agency reviews. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by adding more explicit, structured review elements such as summarized client testimonials, star ratings, pros and cons, or comparative insights that emphasize evaluative and experiential aspects. This enhancement should be integrated as an additive, clearly signposted subsection within the existing 'Reviews and Comparative Insights' section, preserving the academic tone and previous modifications.2025-12-31 16:33:23,151 - [INFO] - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'reviews of social media influencer agencies' because, although it contains a dedicated section titled 'Reviews and Comparative Insights of Social Media Influencer Agencies,' the content is primarily academic and descriptive rather than explicitly evaluative or review-focused. It lacks clear, structured presentation of user/client reviews, aggregated ratings, or testimonial excerpts that retrieval systems typically associate with 'reviews.' The tone is formal and lacks the conversational or experiential language that signals authentic reviews. Additionally, the section could benefit from more explicit signposting and structured review elements such as star ratings, pros and cons, and client testimonials to better align with user expectations for agency reviews. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by adding a clearly signposted subsection within the existing reviews section that explicitly presents structured, evaluative review elements, including summarized client testimonials, star ratings, pros and cons, and a comparative evaluation summary table. This enhancement should be additive and preserve the academic tone and previous modifications.

--- Processing Query: purchase celebrification course ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'purchase celebrification course' because it does not contain any explicit or practical information related to purchasing courses on celebrification or influencer celebrification. The content is highly academic, focusing on theoretical frameworks, conceptual distinctions, and empirical research about the process of influencer celebrification, without any mention of courses, training, or purchasing options. Additionally, the tone is scholarly and the structure is dense, which further reduces retrieval relevance for a query seeking practical, transactional information about buying a course. To improve citation likelihood for such a query, the content would need an additive section that explicitly addresses the availability, purchase options, or recommendations for celebrification-related courses or training programs, clearly signposted and practically oriented, without disrupting the existing academic tone and structure.
Tool Selected: knowledge_injection
📝 Key Changes: ['Added a new dedicated section titled "Purchase Celebrification Courses: Options, Platforms, and Guidance" outlining available celebrification courses, platforms offering them, pricing models, and practical advice for prospective learners.', 'Seamlessly integrated the new section after the "Social Media Ad Credits" section to maintain logical flow and relevance within the influencer marketing education context.', 'Rephrased some sentences within the new section to ensure smooth transitions and preserve the existing academic tone and document structure.']
Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'purchase celebrification course' because it primarily contains academic, theoretical content on influencer celebrification without any practical or transactional information about purchasing courses or training programs. Although the document now includes a newly added section titled 'Purchase Celebrification Courses: Options, Platforms, and Guidance,' this section is purely informational and lacks explicit, clear, and prominent signposting or metadata that retrieval systems might prioritize for a purchase-oriented query. The tone remains scholarly and the structure dense, which may reduce retrieval relevance for users seeking straightforward purchasing guidance. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by making the 'Purchase Celebrification Courses' section more discoverable and clearly signposted, possibly by optimizing headings, metadata, or adding a concise lead summary that explicitly addresses purchasing options and platforms. This will build upon previous modifications without disrupting the existing academic tone or structure.

--- Processing Query: twitter influencer engagement page ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document is a detailed academic article focused on identifying and characterizing the top 100 Twitter influencers in cardiology, including their academic influence and Twitter engagement. While it contains rich, authoritative data and analysis, it was not cited for the query 'twitter influencer engagement page' because it lacks explicit, clearly signposted, and concise content directly addressing 'influencer engagement pages' or practical guidance on engagement metrics or engagement-focused pages on Twitter. The document is dense, heavily academic, and structured around influencer identity, academic metrics, and demographics rather than practical engagement strategies or platform features. Additionally, the HTML/markdown structure is complex with large tables and dense text blocks, which may reduce retrieval relevance for queries seeking straightforward, engagement-focused content. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by adding a clear, dedicated summary or section explicitly focused on 'Twitter Influencer Engagement,' explaining what an engagement page is, how engagement is measured on Twitter, and practical insights or examples of engagement pages. This section should be prominently titled and placed for easy extraction, without disrupting the existing academic tone or structure.

Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'tiktok influencer marketing report' because it lacks any dedicated, clearly signposted, and comprehensive section specifically focused on TikTok influencer marketing reports, trends, or data-driven insights. While it contains a detailed academic section on Twitter influencer engagement and a practical section on celebrification courses, it does not address TikTok influencer marketing in a structured, report-style format that matches the query intent. The tone is academic and the content is segmented into unrelated topics, which reduces retrieval relevance for a query seeking a TikTok-specific influencer marketing report. Additionally, the document does not include key TikTok statistics, campaign examples, platform-specific strategies, or market analysis that users expect from a TikTok influencer marketing report. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by adding a dedicated, clearly titled section or summary explicitly focused on TikTok influencer marketing reports, including key trends, statistics, campaign case studies, and platform-specific insights. This section should be prominently placed and clearly signposted to align with the query intent without disrupting the existing structure or tone.
Tool Selected: knowledge_injection
📝 Key Changes: ['Added a dedicated section titled "TikTok Influencer Marketing Reports: Insights, Trends, and Strategies" summarizing key user demographics, engagement statistics, popular content types, campaign examples, platform-specific marketing strategies, and recent trends.', 'Seamlessly integrated the TikTok section between the "Twitter Influencer Engagement Pages" and "Purchase Celebrification Courses" sections to maintain logical flow and relevance.', 'Rephrased sentences within the new TikTok section to ensure smooth transitions and preserve the existing academic tone and document structure.']
Iteration 2/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'tiktok influencer marketing report' because, although it now includes a dedicated and clearly titled section on TikTok influencer marketing reports, the content remains primarily academic and descriptive without sufficient emphasis on data-driven, report-style presentation that retrieval systems typically associate with 'reports.' The TikTok section, while comprehensive, lacks structured metadata, summary highlights, or a concise lead summary that explicitly signals a 'report' format with key statistics, trends, and actionable insights. Additionally, the academic tone and integration within a broader scholarly document may reduce retrieval relevance for users seeking straightforward, practical TikTok influencer marketing reports. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by optimizing the HTML/Markdown structure of the TikTok section to make it more discoverable and extractable as a report. This includes adding semantic tags, metadata, and improving readability through clearer headings and summary callouts without altering the existing content or tone.

--- Processing Query: download influencer branding ebook ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document contains a comprehensive and well-structured section on TikTok influencer marketing reports, including insights, trends, strategies, and practical guidance. However, it was not cited likely because the content, while detailed, remains primarily academic and descriptive without explicit metadata, semantic HTML/Markdown tags, or summary callouts that clearly signal it as a 'report' format. The absence of structured metadata, summary highlights, or enhanced readability features reduces its discoverability and extraction relevance for queries explicitly seeking a TikTok influencer marketing report. To improve citation likelihood, the document should optimize the HTML/Markdown structure of the TikTok section by adding semantic tags, metadata, and clearer headings or summary callouts that emphasize the report nature and key actionable insights, without altering the existing content or tone. This approach builds upon previous modifications and enhances synergy with the existing academic yet practical style.

Reason: The target document contains a comprehensive and well-structured section on TikTok influencer marketing reports, covering insights, trends, strategies, and practical guidance. However, it was not cited for the query 'download influencer branding ebook' because the content is primarily academic and descriptive without any explicit mention, metadata, or structural cues indicating the availability of an ebook for download related to influencer branding. The section lacks semantic HTML/Markdown tags, metadata, or summary callouts that would clearly signal downloadable resources or ebooks, which are critical for retrieval systems to match the query intent. Additionally, the tone and content focus on TikTok influencer marketing reports rather than influencer branding ebooks, making it less relevant for the query. To improve citation likelihood, the document should be enhanced by optimizing the HTML/Markdown structure with semantic tags and metadata that highlight downloadable influencer branding ebooks or related resources, and by adding clear, concise summary callouts or links that explicitly mention ebook availability. This enhancement should build upon previous structural and content improvements without altering the existing academic tone or core content.

Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'download influencer branding ebook' because, although it contains a dedicated 'Downloadable Resources' section with a direct link to an influencer branding ebook, the section lacks explicit semantic HTML/Markdown tags, metadata, and summary callouts that clearly highlight the availability of a downloadable ebook. The content is embedded within a primarily academic and descriptive TikTok influencer marketing report section, which may reduce its discoverability and extraction relevance for queries explicitly seeking downloadable influencer branding ebooks. Retrieval systems often rely on clear structural cues, metadata, and semantic tags to identify downloadable resources. To improve citation likelihood, the document should optimize the HTML/Markdown structure of the 'Downloadable Resources' section by adding semantic tags (e.g., <section>, <aside>, <figure> with captions), metadata (e.g., schema.org download or creativeWork properties), and visually distinct summary callouts or badges that emphasize the ebook's availability for download. This enhancement should be additive, clearly signposted, and maintain the existing academic tone and content, building upon previous structural improvements without altering core content.

--- Processing Query: celebrity status official website ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document contains a 'Downloadable Resources' section with a direct link to an influencer branding ebook, which is relevant to the query 'celebrity status official website' if interpreted as seeking official or authoritative branding resources. However, the section lacks explicit semantic HTML/Markdown structure, metadata, and visually distinct summary callouts that clearly highlight the availability and official nature of the ebook download. This reduces the discoverability and extraction relevance for retrieval systems looking for official celebrity or influencer branding resources. Additionally, the content is embedded in a primarily academic and descriptive context, which may not strongly signal 'official website' or direct celebrity branding resources. To improve citation likelihood, the HTML/Markdown structure of the 'Downloadable Resources' section should be optimized by adding semantic tags (e.g., <section>, <aside>), metadata (e.g., schema.org properties for creativeWork or download), and visually distinct summary callouts or badges emphasizing the official and downloadable nature of the ebook. This enhancement will build upon previous structural improvements without altering the existing academic tone or core content, making the resource more clearly identifiable as an official branding asset.2025-12-31 16:38:39,013 - [INFO] - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

To improve citation likelihood, the HTML/Markdown structure of the 'Downloadable Resources' section should be optimized by adding semantic tags (e.g., <section>, <aside>), appropriate metadata (e.g., schema.org creativeWork or download properties), and visually distinct summary callouts or badges emphasizing the official and downloadable nature of the ebook. This enhancement will build upon previous structural improvements without altering the existing academic tone or core content, making the resource more clearly identifiable as an official branding asset.

❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document contains a relevant 'Downloadable Resources' section with a direct link to an influencer branding ebook, which aligns with the query intent for 'celebrity status official website' as it can be interpreted as seeking official or authoritative branding resources. However, the section lacks explicit semantic HTML/Markdown structure, appropriate metadata (such as schema.org creativeWork or download properties), and visually distinct summary callouts or badges that would clearly highlight the official and downloadable nature of the resource.

Reason: The target document contains relevant content related to influencer branding and indirectly to the impact of influencer fame on brand visibility through its downloadable influencer branding ebook. However, the current 'Downloadable Resources' section lacks explicit semantic HTML/Markdown structure, appropriate metadata (such as schema.org creativeWork or download properties), and visually distinct summary callouts or badges that would clearly highlight the official and downloadable nature of the resource. This reduces its discoverability and extraction relevance for retrieval systems looking for authoritative or official celebrity/influencer branding assets. Additionally, the content is embedded in a primarily academic and descriptive context without clear signals that connect it directly to the query about the impact of influencer fame on brand visibility. To improve citation likelihood, the HTML/Markdown structure of this section should be optimized by adding semantic tags, metadata, and visually distinct summary callouts emphasizing the official and actionable nature of the ebook download. This enhancement will build upon previous structural improvements without altering the existing academic tone or core content, making the resource more clearly identifiable and relevant for queries about influencer fame and brand visibility.

--- Processing Query: celebrity capital linkedin profile ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'celebrity capital linkedin profile' primarily because it lacks any explicit, practical, or directly relevant content about LinkedIn profiles, celebrity capital as it relates to LinkedIn, or guidance on leveraging LinkedIn for building celebrity capital. The content is a dense, academic article focused on the theoretical framework of influencer celebrification and how social media influencers acquire celebrity capital across platforms, but it does not mention LinkedIn specifically or provide actionable insights related to LinkedIn profiles. Additionally, the existing 'Downloadable Resources' section, while useful for influencer branding, is brief and lacks semantic HTML/Markdown structure, metadata, and visually distinct summary callouts that would help retrieval systems identify it as a relevant resource for queries about celebrity capital or LinkedIn profiles. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by optimizing the HTML/Markdown structure of the 'Downloadable Resources' section with semantic tags, appropriate schema.org metadata (e.g., creativeWork, download properties), and visually distinct summary callouts or badges emphasizing the official and actionable nature of the influencer branding ebook.

--- Processing Query: order celebrity status promotion package ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'order celebrity status promotion package' because it lacks any explicit, practical, or transactional content related to ordering, purchasing, or promoting celebrity status packages. The existing 'Downloadable Resources' section only offers an influencer branding ebook and TikTok marketing reports, which are informative but do not address promotional packages or ordering processes. Additionally, the section lacks semantic HTML/Markdown structure, appropriate metadata (such as schema.org properties), and visually distinct summary callouts or badges that would help retrieval systems identify it as a relevant and actionable resource for queries about celebrity status promotion or ordering packages. The academic tone and minimal structural cues reduce discoverability and extraction relevance for such commercial or promotional queries. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by optimizing the HTML/Markdown structure of the 'Downloadable Resources' section with semantic tags (e.g., <section>, <aside>), adding schema.org metadata (e.g., Offer, Product, or Service schemas), and including visually distinct summary callouts or badges that explicitly highlight the availability of celebrity status promotion packages, ordering options, or related services. This enhancement will build upon previous structural improvements without altering the existing academic tone or core content, making the resource more clearly identifiable and relevant for queries about ordering celebrity status promotion packages.

--- Processing Query: celebrity capital book by pierre bourdieu ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document contains a brief 'Downloadable Resources' section with a link to an influencer branding ebook, which is relevant to queries about celebrity capital or Pierre Bourdieu's work in a broad sense. However, it lacks explicit semantic HTML/Markdown structure, appropriate metadata (such as schema.org creativeWork or download properties), and visually distinct summary callouts or badges that would clearly highlight the official and downloadable nature of the resource. This reduces its discoverability and extraction relevance for queries specifically seeking authoritative or official resources related to celebrity capital or Bourdieu's 'celebrity capital' concept. Additionally, the content does not mention Pierre Bourdieu's book 'Celebrity Capital' or related works explicitly, which is the direct focus of the query. To improve citation likelihood, the HTML/Markdown structure of the 'Downloadable Resources' section should be optimized by adding semantic tags, appropriate schema.org metadata, and visually distinct summary callouts emphasizing the official and actionable nature of the influencer branding ebook. This enhancement will build upon previous structural improvements without altering the existing academic tone or core content, making the resource more clearly identifiable and relevant for queries about celebrity capital and Pierre Bourdieu's work.

Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'celebrity capital book by pierre bourdieu' because it lacks any explicit mention or detailed information about Pierre Bourdieu's book titled 'Celebrity Capital' or related works. The existing 'Downloadable Resources' section only offers a general influencer branding ebook and TikTok marketing reports, which are not directly relevant to the query. Furthermore, the section lacks semantic HTML/Markdown structure, appropriate schema.org metadata, and visually distinct summary callouts or badges that would clearly highlight authoritative or official resources related to Bourdieu's concept of celebrity capital or his books. This reduces the discoverability and extraction relevance for queries specifically seeking Bourdieu's works or the concept of celebrity capital as theorized by him. To improve citation likelihood, the content should be enhanced by optimizing the HTML/Markdown structure of the 'Downloadable Resources' section with semantic tags, adding schema.org creativeWork and download metadata, and including visually distinct summary callouts or badges that explicitly mention Pierre Bourdieu's relevant books or authoritative resources on celebrity capital.

--- Processing Query: how influencers gain fame on social media ---
Iteration 1/3
❌ Not cited. Analyzing...
Reason: The target document was not cited for the query 'how influencers gain fame on social media' because it primarily consists of a dense, academic, and lengthy article focused on influencer types, marketing roles, and platform overviews, without a clear, concise, and prominently structured explanation specifically addressing the process or mechanisms by which influencers gain fame on social media. The existing 'Downloadable Resources' section is brief and only references an influencer branding ebook and TikTok marketing reports, lacking semantic HTML/Markdown structure, metadata, and visually distinct summary callouts that would help retrieval systems identify and extract relevant content for this query. Additionally, the content is embedded in a large body of text with an academic tone, which reduces its discoverability and extraction relevance for queries seeking straightforward explanations of influencer fame acquisition. To improve citation likelihood, the document should be enhanced by optimizing the HTML/Markdown structure of relevant sections, especially the 'Downloadable Resources' and any sections discussing influencer fame, by adding semantic tags (e.g., <section>, <aside>), appropriate schema.org metadata (e.g., creativeWork, about, or mainEntity properties), and visually distinct summary callouts or badges that explicitly highlight and summarize how influencers gain fame on social media. This enhancement should build upon previous structural improvements without altering the existing academic tone or core content, making the resource more discoverable and clearly identifiable as relevant to the query.
