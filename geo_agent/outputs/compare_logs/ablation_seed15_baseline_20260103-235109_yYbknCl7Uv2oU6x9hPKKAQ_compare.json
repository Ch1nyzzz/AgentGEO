    "original": "The Roman dynasty was spread over many decades, and gave rise to some of the longest living systems of law, architecture, etc. Read on for a list of all the rulers of this great empire…\nThe history of the ancient empire of Rome has always managed to fascinate us. The Roman empire derives its origin from the Roman Republic after its ascent to the dominant power in Europe. Thus, Augustus, who is universally considered the first Roman emperor, was careful to always maintain the facade of republican rule, and did not take up any specific title to mark his rule, which began in 27 B.C. Given below is a list starting with Augustus until Justin II.\nList of Roman Emperors\n- Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus\n- Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus\n- Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\n- Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\n- Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\n- Servius Sulpicius Galba\n- Marcus Salvius Otho\n- Aulus Vitellius Germanicus\n- Titus Flavius Vespasianus\n- Titus Flavius Vespasianus\n- Titus Flavius Domitianus\n- Marcus Cocceius Nerva\n- Marcus Ulpius Nerva Traianus\n- Publius Aelius Hadrianus\n- Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus (Antoninus Pius)\n- Lucius Aurelius Verus\n- Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus\n- Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus\n- Publius Helvius Pertinax\n- Marcus Didius Severus Julianus\n- Lucius Septimius Severus\n- Caracalla\n- Publius Septimius Geta\n- Marcus Opellius Macrinus\n- Marcus Opellius Antoninus Diadumenianus\n- Elagabalus\n- Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander\n- Gaius Iulius Verus Maximinus (Maximinus I)\n- Marcus Antonius Gordianus Sempronianus Romanus Africanus (Gordian I)\n- Marcus Antonius Gordianus Sempronianus Romanus Africanus (Gordian II)\n- Marcus Clodius Pupienus Maximus\n- Decimus Caelius Calvinus Balbinus\n- Marcus Antonius Gordianus Pius (Gordian III)\n- Marcus Julius Philippus (Philip the Arab)\n- Gaius Messius Quintus Decius\n- Gaius Valens Hostilianus Messius Quintus\n- Gaius Vibius Trebonianus Gallus\n- Marcus Aemilius Aemilianus\n- Publius Licinius Valerianus\n- Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus\n- Marcus Aurelius Claudius\n- Marcus Aurelius Claudius Quintillus\n- Lucius Domitius Aurelianus\n- Marcus Claudius Tacitus\n- Marcus Annius Florianus\n- Marcus Aurelius Probus\n- Marcus Aurelius Carus\n- Marcus Aurelius Numerius Numerianus\n- Marcus Aurelius Carinus\n- Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus\n- Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maximianus Herculius\n- Flavius Valerius Constantius (Constantius Chlorus)\n- Galerius Maximianus\n- Flavius Valerius Severus\n- Caesar Flavius Valerius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus (Constantine I or Emperor Constantine)\n- Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maxentius\n- Gaius Valerius Galerius Maximinus (Maximinus II)\n- Valerius Licinianus Licinius\n- Flavius Claudius Constantinus (Constantine II)\n- Flavius Iulius Constantius (Constantius II)\n- Flavius Julius Constans\n- Flavius Claudius Iulianus (Julian the Apostate)\n- Flavius Iovianus (Jovian)\n- Flavius Valentinianus\n- Flavius Julius Valens\n- Flavius Gratianus\n- Flavius Valentinianus (Valentinian II)\n- Theodosius I\n- Flavius Arcadius\n- Flavius Honorius\n- Flavius Theodosius (Theodosius II)\n- Flavius Constantius (Constantius III)\n- Joannes\n- Flavius Placidius Valentinianus (Valentinian III)\n- Flavius Marcianus\n- Flavius Petronius Maximus\n- Eparchius Avitus\n- Flavius Iulius Valerius Maiorianus\n- Flavius Libius Severus Serpentius\n- Procopius Anthemius\n- Anicius Olybrius\n- Glycerius\n- Julius Nepos\n- Romulus Augustus\n- Flavius Valerius Leo (Leo I the Thracian)\n- Flavius Leo Junior (Leo II)\n- Flavius Zeno\n- Flavius Basiliscus\n- Flavius Anastasius\n- Flavius Iustinus (Justin I)\n- Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus (Justinian I)\n- Flavius Iustinus (Junior) Augustus (Justin II)\nEven though Romulus Augustus is considered to have been the last Roman emperor, he was actually an usurper, and is not included in the list.

However, no one can deny them the various achievements that marked the era, like their art, literature and architecture.",
    "optimized": "The Roman dynasty spanned many decades and gave rise to enduring systems of law, architecture, and governance. The history of the ancient Roman Empire continues to fascinate, originating from the Roman Republic as it rose to dominance in Europe. Augustus, widely regarded as the first Roman emperor, began his rule in 27 B.C. while maintaining the appearance of republican governance without adopting a specific imperial title. Below is a comprehensive list of Roman emperors from Augustus to Justin II.\n\nOne of the most pivotal moments in Roman history was the assassination of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March (March 15, 44 BC). This event took place at the Theatre of Pompey, where Caesar was stabbed to death by a group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius. The political motivations behind the assassination stemmed from fears that Caesar’s accumulation of power threatened the Republic’s foundations and the senators’ own influence. During the stabbing, Caesar reportedly reacted with shock and betrayal, famously uttering \"Et tu, Brute?\" as he recognized Brutus among his attackers. The immediate aftermath plunged Rome into chaos, with Mark Antony delivering a powerful funeral oration that swayed public opinion against the conspirators. This speech ignited widespread unrest and ultimately led to a series of civil wars, which paved the way for the rise of Augustus and the transition from Republic to Empire.\n\nThe influence of Roman emperors extends far beyond their reigns, profoundly shaping modern Europe. Their codification of Roman law laid the foundation for many contemporary legal systems, influencing medieval and modern European jurisprudence. In governance, the administrative structures and bureaucratic practices developed under the emperors served as models for later European monarchies and republics. Architecturally, Roman innovations such as arches, aqueducts, and monumental public buildings inspired Renaissance and neoclassical architecture. The Latin language, propagated by the empire, became the root of the Romance languages and the lingua franca of educated Europeans for centuries. Additionally, Roman emperors played a pivotal role in spreading Christianity, especially after Constantine I’s endorsement, shaping Europe’s religious landscape. Cultural institutions like public baths, theaters, and forums established social frameworks that influenced medieval and modern European public life and civic engagement.\n\nFor enthusiasts, educators, and collectors, Roman emperors timeline posters are available for purchase, offering a visually engaging and educational resource. These posters typically feature detailed chronological timelines of emperors, accompanied by portraits and key historical events, making them ideal for classrooms, homes, or personal collections. Printed on high-quality materials such as durable matte or glossy paper, the posters come in various sizes ranging from standard A2 (16.5 x 23.4 inches) to larger formats like 24 x 36 inches, catering to different display needs. Pricing generally ranges from $15 to $50 depending on size and print quality.\n\nThese timeline posters can be purchased through multiple channels, including online stores specializing in historical and educational materials, museum gift shops with Roman history exhibits, and educational suppliers catering to schools and universities. The visual layout of these posters aids in understanding the succession and historical context of Roman emperors, enhancing learning and appreciation of Roman history.\n\n### Audiobooks on Augustus  \nFor those interested in exploring the life and legacy of Augustus through audio format, several popular audiobooks are available. A notable title is *Augustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor* by Anthony Everitt, narrated by John Curless. This audiobook offers a detailed and engaging narrative of Augustus’s rise to power, his political acumen, and his lasting impact on Rome and the world.
