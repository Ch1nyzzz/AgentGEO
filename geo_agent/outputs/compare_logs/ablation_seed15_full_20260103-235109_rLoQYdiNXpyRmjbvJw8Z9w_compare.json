    "original": "Difference between Management and Administration\nKey difference: Administration frames the objectives and policies of an organization. Management implements these policies and objectives.\nManagement and administration are at times used interchangeably; however, they are two different levels of the organization. The administration is the top level of the organization with the decisive functions. They are responsible for determining the policies and objectives of the organization or the firm. Management, on the other hand is the middle level executive function. They implement the policies and objectives as decided by the administration.\nThe administration includes the people who are either owners or partners of the firm. They usually contribute to the firm’s capital and earn profits or returns on their investment. The main administrative function is handling the business aspects of the firm, such as finance. Other administrative functions usually include planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling and budgeting. Administration must integrate leadership and vision, to organize the people and resources, in order to achieve common goals and objectives for the organization.\nManagement usually incorporates the employees of the firm who use their skills for the firm in return for remuneration. Management is responsible for carrying out the strategies of the administration. Motivation is the key factor of a management. Management must motivate and handle the employees. It can be said that management is directly under the control of administration.\nFurther comparison between management and administration:\n|\n|\nManagement |\nAdministration |\n|\nDefinition |\nArt of getting things done through others by directing their efforts towards achievement of pre-determined goals. |\nFormulation of broad objectives, plans & policies. |\n|\nNature |\nexecuting function, doing function |\ndecision-making function, thinking function |\n|\nScope |\nDecisions within the framework set by the administration. |\nMajor decisions of an enterprise as a whole. |\n|\nLevel of authority |\nMiddle level activity |\nTop level activity |\n|\nStatus |\nGroup of managerial personnel who use their specialized knowledge to fulfill the objectives of an enterprise. |\nConsists of owners who invest capital in and receive profits from an enterprise. |\n|\nUsage |\nUsed in business enterprises. |\nPopular with government, military, educational, and religious organizations. |\n|\nInfluence |\nDecisions are influenced by the values, opinions, beliefs and decisions of the managers. |\nInfluenced by public opinion, government policies, customs etc. |\n|\nMain functions |\nMotivating and controlling |\nPlanning and organizing |\n|\nAbilities |\nHandles the employees. |\nHandles the business aspects such as finance. |\nComments\nOlaa Michael\nThu, 08/24/2017 - 20:48\nTsehay\nMon, 08/21/2017 - 23:46\nTeja\nWed, 07/12/2017 - 20:27\ns.sangavi\nSat, 07/08/2017 - 13:28\naman\nThu, 05/04/2017 - 20:04\nAbdinasir\nSun, 10/23/2016 - 01:41\nAxel\nSun, 07/17/2016 - 10:07\nKayawe Patrrick\nSun, 07/03/2016 - 23:04\nJahanzaib Marwat\nFri, 05/13/2016 - 20:43\nkusum\nFri, 12/18/2015 - 01:38\nPages\nAdd new comment",

Overseeing team performance to ensure productivity aligns with organizational goals and standards.  \n  - Conducting training and development sessions to enhance employee skills, compliance, and engagement.  \n  - Enforcing adherence to company policies, safety standards, and operational procedures consistently.  \n  - Setting clear daily or weekly goals, monitoring workflow, and promptly resolving operational issues to maintain efficiency.  \n  - Providing ongoing motivation and leadership to inspire team members toward achieving excellence.  \n  - Reporting team performance, challenges, and feedback to middle management to inform strategic decisions.  \n- Unlike managers, supervisors generally have limited authority regarding hiring, firing, and budget control, focusing instead on operational oversight and team leadership.  \n- Supervisors embody leadership and motivational skills essential for driving team success, operational excellence, and fostering a collaborative and accountable work environment.  \n- Their role is pivotal in maintaining alignment between the strategic objectives set by administration and the practical execution managed by middle management, ensuring that organizational goals are met effectively.  \n\nLeadership Training Programs for HR Professionals  \n-------------------------------------------------  \n- Designed to develop leadership skills aligning with both administrative vision and managerial execution in HR contexts.  \n- Enrollment typically requires application through HR departments or direct registration, often needing HR-related backgrounds.  \n- Benefits include enhanced decision-making, strategic planning, and effective motivation of HR teams.  \n- Bridges the gap between policy-setting (administration) and implementation (management) in HR leadership.  \n- Equips HR leaders to engage in both policy formulation and employee management, embodying dual leadership roles.  \n- **Enrollment Procedures and Course Details:**  \n  -
