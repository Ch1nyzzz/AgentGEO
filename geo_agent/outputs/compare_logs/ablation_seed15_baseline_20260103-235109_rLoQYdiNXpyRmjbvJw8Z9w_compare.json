    "original": "Difference between Management and Administration\nKey difference: Administration frames the objectives and policies of an organization. Management implements these policies and objectives.\nManagement and administration are at times used interchangeably; however, they are two different levels of the organization. The administration is the top level of the organization with the decisive functions. They are responsible for determining the policies and objectives of the organization or the firm. Management, on the other hand is the middle level executive function. They implement the policies and objectives as decided by the administration.\nThe administration includes the people who are either owners or partners of the firm. They usually contribute to the firm’s capital and earn profits or returns on their investment. The main administrative function is handling the business aspects of the firm, such as finance. Other administrative functions usually include planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling and budgeting. Administration must integrate leadership and vision, to organize the people and resources, in order to achieve common goals and objectives for the organization.\nManagement usually incorporates the employees of the firm who use their skills for the firm in return for remuneration. Management is responsible for carrying out the strategies of the administration. Motivation is the key factor of a management. Management must motivate and handle the employees. It can be said that management is directly under the control of administration.\nFurther comparison between management and administration:\n|\n|\nManagement |\nAdministration |\n|\nDefinition |\nArt of getting things done through others by directing their efforts towards achievement of pre-determined goals. |\nFormulation of broad objectives, plans & policies. |\n|\nNature |\nexecuting function, doing function |\ndecision-making function, thinking function |\n|\nScope |\nDecisions within the framework set by the administration. |\nMajor decisions of an enterprise as a whole. |\n|\nLevel of authority |\nMiddle level activity |\nTop level activity |\n|\nStatus |\nGroup of managerial personnel who use their specialized knowledge to fulfill the objectives of an enterprise. |\nConsists of owners who invest capital in and receive profits from an enterprise. |\n|\nUsage |\nUsed in business enterprises. |\nPopular with government, military, educational, and religious organizations. |\n|\nInfluence |\nDecisions are influenced by the values, opinions, beliefs and decisions of the managers. |\nInfluenced by public opinion, government policies, customs etc. |\n|\nMain functions |\nMotivating and controlling |\nPlanning and organizing |\n|\nAbilities |\nHandles the employees. |\nHandles the business aspects such as finance. |\nComments\nOlaa Michael\nThu, 08/24/2017 - 20:48\nTsehay\nMon, 08/21/2017 - 23:46\nTeja\nWed, 07/12/2017 - 20:27\ns.sangavi\nSat, 07/08/2017 - 13:28\naman\nThu, 05/04/2017 - 20:04\nAbdinasir\nSun, 10/23/2016 - 01:41\nAxel\nSun, 07/17/2016 - 10:07\nKayawe Patrrick\nSun, 07/03/2016 - 23:04\nJahanzaib Marwat\nFri, 05/13/2016 - 20:43\nkusum\nFri, 12/18/2015 - 01:38\nPages\nAdd new comment",

Administration operates at the executive or top management level, responsible for establishing objectives and policies with strategic and decisive authority. Management functions at the middle management level, focusing on implementing these policies and objectives through operational activities.\n\n|                      | Management                                                                 | Administration                                                      |  \n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|  \n| Definition           | The art and science of accomplishing organizational goals through directing and coordinating the efforts of others. | The process of formulating broad organizational objectives, plans, and policies.                 |  \n| Nature               | Operational and execution-oriented function                              | Strategic decision-making and policy formulation function          |  \n| Scope                | Tactical decisions within the framework established by administration.    | Strategic decisions impacting the enterprise as a whole.           |  \n| Level of authority   | Middle management level                                                   | Executive/top management level                                     |  \n| Status               | Comprises professional managers utilizing specialized knowledge to achieve enterprise objectives. | Consists of owners or board members who invest capital and receive profits. |  \n| Usage                | Predominantly applied in business enterprises.                           | Commonly associated with government, military, educational, and religious institutions. |  \n| Influence            | Decisions influenced by managerial expertise, organizational culture, and operational constraints. | Influenced by external factors such as public opinion, government regulations, and societal norms. |  \n| Main functions       | Motivating, directing, and controlling operational activities.            | Planning, organizing, and policy formulation.                      |  \n| Abilities            | Manages human resources and operational processes.                       | Oversees financial management and strategic resource allocation.  |  \n\n## Administration\n\nAdministration typically includes owners or partners who invest capital and receive returns. Its primary responsibilities encompass strategic planning, financial oversight, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling, and budgeting. Administration integrates visionary leadership and governance to coordinate human and material resources, ensuring alignment with organizational goals.\n\nGovernance plays a crucial role in administration by establishing frameworks and policies that guide organizational conduct, risk management, and compliance. In procurement, governance frameworks ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical standards in purchasing decisions, aligning procurement activities with the organization's strategic objectives and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Management\n\nManagement generally consists of salaried employees who apply specialized skills to execute the administration’s strategies. Key duties include motivating employees and managing performance under the supervision and authority of the administration.\n\nIn procurement processes, management is responsible for operationalizing governance policies by overseeing supplier selection, contract management, and purchase execution. Effective procurement management ensures that purchasing decisions are efficient, cost-effective, and compliant with governance standards.\n\n# Role of a Supervisor in a Company\n\nA supervisor plays a critical role within the management hierarchy as the frontline leader responsible for overseeing team performance and ensuring productivity. Supervisors serve as the vital link between management and employees, facilitating communication, clarifying expectations, and addressing workplace issues promptly.\n\nKey responsibilities include monitoring daily operations, conducting training sessions to enhance employee skills, enforcing company policies and procedures, and providing feedback to both employees and higher management. Unlike managers, supervisors typically have limited authority regarding hiring and firing decisions and do not control budgets, focusing instead on operational execution and team coordination.\n\nSupervisors maintain workflow efficiency, resolve conflicts, and foster a positive work environment. Their role bridges strategic directives from management with practical employee performance, ensuring organizational goals are met through effective team leadership.\n\n# Leadership Training Programs for HR Professionals\n\nLeadership training programs tailored for HR professionals bridge the gap between administration and management by developing competencies in strategic decision-making, employee motivation, conflict resolution, and organizational leadership—critical for aligning administrative strategy with managerial execution.\n\n## Examples of Available Courses and Certifications\n\n- **Certified Professional in Human Resources (CPHR) Leadership Program:** Focuses on strategic HR leadership and organizational development.  \n- **SHRM Senior Certified Professional (SHRM-SCP):** Emphasizes leadership in HR policy implementation and strategic management.  \n- **Leadership Development for HR Managers:** Covers change management, leadership communication, and employee engagement strategies.  \n- **Online courses on Coursera and LinkedIn Learning:** Offer flexible modules on leadership fundamentals tailored for HR professionals.  \n\nThese programs empower HR professionals to contribute effectively to both management and administration, enhancing organizational performance and sustainability.\n\n## How to Enroll\n\nEnrollment is available through accredited HR bodies, universities, and reputable online platforms.
